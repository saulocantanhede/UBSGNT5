It is very tempting to connect up all the clauses in this quotation and make them O to λέγοντος. However, since they are some longer quotations that would cause problems and to maintain consistency, I refrain here and for the rest of Mat for similar constructions.

OUDE is really a combination of the negative OU and the conjunction DE. Both functions cannot be represented at the same time in the current system.

 These two participles have the grass as their subject, giving attendant circumstances in relation to it: \\"If God thus clothes the grass, even though it exists today and is cast into the fire tomorrow.\\

In the Massoretic accents of the quote from Isaiah are followed, then \\"in the wilderness\\" may be where to prepare rather than where the crying out is done: \\"In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord.\\



















Not too much should be read into this description clause that tells us a little more about John as the one who was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism associated with a repentance that leads to the forgiveness of sins.


Many read too much into whether \\"for the forgiveness of sins\\" modifies baptism or repentance. It could also modify the verb. Given Luke24:47, connection with repentance is most likely.

GAR usually introduces an independent clauses or series of clauses that support a previous series of clauses. Here it support this parenthetical aside and therefore gets included in this sentence (while still being Conj-CL).


This participial clause is actually parallel with the ADV participial clause (\\"realizing the grace that has been given me)  that follows the parenthetical GAR clause.









\\"The gospel\\" is elided and carried over from previous clause.


Event (at own clause level)















































The interpretation taken here is that the elided V is something like \\"they asked.\\" The relative clause is not connected by NP-CL because it is really referring to the hINA clause and so I used ClCl to connect here.

State (at own clause level)





The AUTW is really the object of the preposition that is prefixed to the compound verb. So, it is probably better to take this pron as ADV, rather than IO or even O.





























Attribute (at own clause level)













It is hard to decide where the quotation ends and where Paul is describing the general content of his speech to his Galatian audience. The switch from \\"we\\" to \\"I\\" happens in 2:18:1; the switch of direct address of the Galatians happens in 3:1:1. The current sentence breaks have the virtue of being shorter and more processing friendly.




















I think this KAI is a conj linking to \\"no human\\" in the previous clause.






























Modifies implied subject we: [We] ourselves also are found [to be] sinners.










Left-dislocated topic focus clause.






























State (at own clause level)






































ClCl used for relative clause because  of word order and also relative clause is non-restricting, and more like using a pronoun to continue with predication with the same referent.

The hOSTIS is generalizing instead of pointing to a specific referent; it is really a P & the S of the previous CL is carried over as S of the VC; for these reasons, I chose to use the ClCl rule.

The relative pronoun may have either Lord or cross as its antecedent. Tree assumes cross, with play on meaning of the verb crucify and the noun cross.

(SYNTAX) Having an articular genitive modifier for the head np after an det np det adjp construction would be unprecedented. So, it seems that we have \\"the Spirit,\\" namely \\"the holy one from God.\\" In the end, this still means \\"the Holy Spirit from God.\\" However, syntactically, it is put together differently than what is usually done.

















































































2 separate Conj2CL was used instead of Conj3CL because the first two are in a coordinating relationship whereas the third is in an adversative relationship to the first two.




























The use of the neuter pronoun probably favors a reference to the whole previous np rather than just \\"covetous person.\\

The neuter pronoun leads me to think it likely that the whole np is the referent, rather than just the feminine noun \\"sword.\\






























This could also be a that-VP clause in apposition to \\"petition\\" (in which case \\"for all the saints and for me\\" would be pp to petitions (NP-PP and then NP-Appos).
























































This demonstrative may refer both backward and forward to the two hINA clauses (so that the hINA clause that follows may be a that-VP clause in apposition to TOUTO--but this could not be shown together with the current tree).




Paul apparently refers to himself and other co-workers not mentioned elsewhere in the letter (except the messenger here, Tychicus, who is the only one named).

Both Euodia and Syntyche are called upon to think (both are implied subjects of the infinitival clause). The infinitival clause is O2 (or O if Euodia and Syntyche are subsumed inside the infinitival clause as explicit S) for both finite verbs


























The pronoun should cover at least Clement & the rest of the co-workers and at least indirectly (through the concept of co-worker) to Euodia and Syntache. Alternatively, this pronoun could directly refer to Euodia and Syntache only

















With active voice verb, this would have been the subject: \\"Let all people know your reasonableness.\\" In this passive construction, the recipient of knowledge is in dative, for which IO (intended receiving object) is appropriate

On the problems with this being nominative, see G. K. Beal's NIGTC commentary on Revelation. Beal is probably right that this is nominative to make clear an OT allusion; the function is genitive.



















Also possible that the hOTI clause further identifies a few things and so should be NP-CL in relation to it.

Assumes \\"has come\\" from previous clause carries over. The basic structure is an elided clause “the time [has come].” Syntax is difficult, but clear that the genitive modifier & the three infinitival clauses further specify what “time” it is.

Textual uncertainty. He stood would refer to the dragon and so concludes 11:19–12:17 by providing a transition to 13:1–18. I stood would refer to John and would be introducing a new text unit in 12:18–13:18.





































































3 possibilites for why this is accusative. First, just another grammatical problem from the author. Second, assumes an elided verb like \\"I saw.\\" Third, carries over \\"the dragon gave\\" (gave that the beast would have a mortal wound that was healed as a sign to further deceive the whole earth. The third option is best in my mind, followed by the second.
