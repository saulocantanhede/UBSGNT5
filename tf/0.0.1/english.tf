the
husband
of Mary,
from
whom
was born
Jesus
the one
being called
Christ.
all
thus ~
the
generations
from
Abraham
to
David [were]
fourteen ~ generations,
*
and
from
David
to
the
deportation
to Babylon,
generations,
fourteen ~
and
from
the
deportation
to Babylon
to
the
Christ,
fourteen ~ generations.
*
-
now
of Jesus
Christ
the
birth
was ~ thus.
*
being engaged
the
mother
of him
Mary
-
to Joseph,
before
*
came together
they ~ 
she was found
pregnant
*
*
by
[the] holy ~ spirit.
*
now ~ Joseph,
*
the
husband
of her,
righteous
being ~ 
and
not
wishing
to disgrace ~ her,
*
decided
secretly
to divorce
her.
[on] these things
now
he
[while] ~ was thinking,
behold
an angel
of  [the] lord
in
a dream
appeared
to him
saying,
Joseph,
son
of David
not
do be afraid
to take
Mary [to be]
the
wife
of you;
for ~ the [child]
*
in
her
having been conceived
from
spirit
is
[the] holy.
she will bear
and ~ 
a son,
and
you will call
the
name
of him
Jesus,
for ~ he
*
will save
the
people
of him
from
the
sins
of them.
now ~ this
*
all
occurred
that
might be fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
by
[the] lord
through
the
prophet
saying,
behold
the
virgin
will be pregnant
*
*
and
she will bear
a son,
and
they will call
the
name
of him
Immanuel,
which
means
having been interpreted
with
us
-
god.
rising up
then ~
-
Joseph
from
-
sleep
he did
as
commanded
him
the
angel
of [the] lord
and
he took
the
wife
of him,
and
not
he did know
her
until
*
she bore
a son;
and
he called
the
name
of him
Jesus.
-
now
Jesus
having been born
in
Bethlehem
-
of Judea
in
[the] days
of Herod
the
king,
behold
magi
from
[the] east
arrived
in
Jerusalem.
saying,
where
is
the one
having been born
king
of the
Jews?
for ~ we saw
*
his
-
star
in
the
east
and
we came
to worship
him.
having heard [this]
now ~
-
king
Herod
was troubled
and
all
Jerusalem
with
him.
and
having assembled
all
the
chief priests
and
scribes
of the
people
he inquired
from
them
where
the
Christ
is being born.
they
and ~ 
said
to him,
in
Bethlehem
-
of Judea;
thus
for ~ 
it has been written
through
the
prophet:
and
you
Bethlehem,
[in the] land
of Judah,
by no means
least
are you
among
the
rulers
of Judah.
from
you
for
will come
a ruler,
who
will shepherd
the
people
of me
-
Israel.
then
Herod
secretly
having called
the
magi
ascertained
from
them
the
time
of the
appearing
of [the] star,
and
having sent
them
to
Bethlehem
he said,
going
inquire
carefully
concerning
the
child;
when
and
you find [him],
report
to me,
so that
I also
coming
may worship
him.
~ they,
so
having listened
to the
king,
departed
and
behold
the
star,
which
they saw
in
the
east,
went before
them,
until
having come
it stood
over 
[the place] where
was
the
child.
and ~ seeing
*
the
star,
they rejoiced
joy
great
[with] exceeding.
and
coming
into
the
house
they saw
the
child
with
Mary
the
mother
of him,
and
falling down,
they worshiped
him
and
having opened
the
treasures
of them,
they offered
to him
gifts,
gold
and
frankincense
and
myrrh.
and
having been warned
in
a dream
not
to return
to
Herod,
by
another
way
they departed
to
the
country
of them.
[after]  departed,
now
they
behold
an angel
of [the] lord
appeared
in
a dream
-
to Joseph
saying,
rising up
take
the
child
and
the
mother
of him
and
flee
to
Egypt
and
remain
there
until
*
I tell
you;
is about
for
Herod
to seek
the
child
-
to kill
it.
-
so
having arisen,
he took
the
child
and
the
mother
of him
during [the] night
and
departed
for
Egypt.
and
he was
there
until
the
death
of Herod;
in order that
might be fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
by
[the] lord
through
the
prophet
saying,
out of
Egypt
I called
the
son
of me.
then
Herod,
seeing
that
he was deceived
by
the
magi,
was enraged
greatly,
and
having sent [orders]
he killed
all
the
male children
-
in
Bethlehem
and
in
all
the
districts
of it
from
two years old
and
under,
according to
the
time
which
he ascertained
from
the
magi.
then
was fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying,
a voice
in
Ramah
was heard,
weeping
and
mourning
great;
Rachel
weeping [for]
the
children
of her,
and
and
she would not
be comforted,
because
~ not
they are ~.
now ~ having died
*
-
Herod,
behold
an angel
of [the] lord
appeared
in
a dream
-
to Joseph
in
Egypt
saying,
rising up
take
the
child
and
the
mother
of him
and
go
into
[the] land
of Israel.
for ~ have died
*
the ones
seeking
the
life
of the
child.
-
so
having arisen
he took
the
child
and
the
mother
of him
and
entered
into
[the] land
of Israel.
~ having heard
but
that
Archelaus
is (was) reigning [over]
-
Judea
instead
of the
father
of him,
Herod,
he was afraid
~ there.
to go
and ~ having been warned
*
in
a dream,
he departed
into
the
districts
-
of Galilee,
and
having come
he settled
in
[the] city
called
Nazareth;
so that
might be fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
the
prophets
-
a Nazarene
he will be called.
now ~ in
*
-
those ~ days
*
comes
John
the
baptist
preaching
in
the
wilderness
-
of Judea
-
saying,
repent;
has come near
for ~
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
for ~ this
*
is
the one
spoken [of]
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying,
a voice
shouting
in
the
wilderness:
prepare
the
way
of [the] lord,
make ~ straight
*
the
paths
of him.
himself
now
-
John
had
the
clothing
of him
from
[the] hairs
of a camel
and
a leather ~ belt
*
around
the
waist
of him,
and ~ the
*
food
~ was
of him ~
locusts
and
wild ~ honey.
*
then
went out
to
him
Jerusalem
and
all
-
Judea
and
all
the
region around
the
Jordan,
and
they were baptized
in
the
Jordan
river
by
him
confessing
the
sins
of them.
and ~ seeing
*
many
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
coming
to
the
baptism
of him
he said
to them,
children
of vipers,
who
warned
you
to flee
from
the
coming
wrath?
therefore ~ produce
*
fruit
worthy
-
of repentance
and
not 
do think
to say
within
yourselves,
[as our] father
we have
-
Abraham.
for ~ I say
*
to you
that
is able
-
God
from
-
these ~stones
*
to raise up
children
-
to Abraham.
and ~ already
*
the
axe
at
the
root
of the
trees
is laid;
therefore ~ every
*
tree
not
producing
good ~ fruit
*
is cut down
and
into
[the] fire
is thrown.
I
-
baptize ~ you
*
with
water
[leading] to
repentance,
~ the one
but
after
me
coming
stronger
than me
is,
of whom
I am not
*
worthy
the
sandals
to remove.
he
you
will baptize ~ 
with
[the] holy ~ spirit
*
and
fire;
of whom
the
winnowing shovel [is]
in
the
hand
of him
and
he will clean out
the
threshing
of him
and
he will gather
the
wheat
of him
into
the
barn,
the
but ~ 
chaff
he will consume
with fire.
an inextinguishable
then
comes
-
Jesus
from
-
Galilee
to
the
Jordan
to
-
John
-
to be baptized
by
him.
-
but
John
tried to prevent
him
saying,
I
have ~ need
*
by
you
to be baptized,
and [yet]
you
come
to
me?
but ~ answering
*
-
Jesus
said
to
him,
permit [it]
now,
thus
for ~ 
it is ~ proper
*
for us
to fulfill
all
righteousness.
then
he permits
him.
having been baptized,
and
-
Jesus
immediately
came up
from
the
water.
and
behold
were opened
to him
the
heavens,
and
he saw
the
spirit
-
of god
descending
like
a dove
and
coming
upon
him.
and
behold
a voice [came]
out
of the
heavens
saying,
this
is
the
son
of me
the
beloved,
in
whom
I am well pleased.
then
-
Jesus
was led up
into
the
wilderness
by
the
spirit
to be tempted
by
the
devil.
and
having fasted
forty ~ days
*
and
forty ~ nights,
*
afterwards
he hungered.
and
having approached,
the one
tempting
said
to him,
if
you are ~ [the] son
*
-
of god,
speak
that
-
these ~ stones
*
may become ~ bread.
*
the one
but ~ 
having answered
said,
it has been written,
not
by
bread
alone
will live
-
man,
but
by
every
word
proceeding
through
the mouth
of god.
then
takes
him
the
devil
to
the
holy
city
and
set
him
upon
the
pinnacle
of the
temple,
and
says
to him,
if
[the] son
you are ~ 
-
of god,
throw
yourself
down.
~ it has been written
for
-
the
angels
of him
he will command
concerning
you
and
upon
[their] hands
they will lift up
you,
lest
you strike
against
a stone
the
foot
of you.
said
to him
-
Jesus,
again
it has been written,
not 
do tempt
[the] lord
the
god
of you.
again
takes
him
the
devil
to
mountain
high
a very
and
shows
to him
all
the
kingdoms
of the
world
and
the
glory
of them
and
he said
to him,
these things
to you
all
I will give,
if
falling down
you may worship
me.
then
says
to him
-
Jesus,
go away,
Satan,
for ~ it has been written,
*
[the] lord
the
god
of you
you shall worship
and
him
alone
you shall serve.
then
leaves
him
the devil,
devil,
and
behold
angels
came
and
served
him.
~ having heard
now
that
John
was arrested
he departed
into
-
Galilee.
and
having left behind
-
Nazareth,
having come
he settled
in
Capernaum
-
beside the sea
in
[the] districts
of Zebulun
and
Naphtali,
so that
might be fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying,
land
of Zebulun
and
land
of Naphtali,
road
to the sea,
beyond
the
Jordan,
Galilee
of the
gentiles,
the
people
-
sitting
in
darkness
light
saw
a great,
and
to the ones
sitting
in
[the] land
and
shadow
of death,
a light
rose up
among them.
from
then
began
-
Jesus
to preach
and
to say,
repent,
for ~ is near
*
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
walking
and
beside
the
sea
-
of Galilee
he saw
two
brothers,
Simon,
the one
being called
Peter,
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him,
casting
a net
into
the
sea;
for ~ they were
*
fishermen.
and
he says
to them,
come
follow
me,
and
I will make
you
fishermen
of men.
-
and
immediately
leaving
the
nets
they followed
him.
and
having gone on
from there
he saw
two ~ other
*
brothers,
James
the [son]
-
of Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him,
in
the
boat
with
Zebedee
the
father
of them,
repairing
the
nets
of them,
and
he called
them.
-
and
immediately
leaving
the
boat
and
the
father
of them
they followed
him.
and
he went about
in
all
-
Galilee
teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
and
preaching
the
good news
of the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
every
illness
among
the
people.
and
went out
the
report
of him
into
all
-
Syria;
and
they brought
to him
all
the ones
~ illness
having
various
diseases
and
suffering from ~ torments
*
and
being demon-possessed
and
epileptics
and
paralytics,
and
he healed
them.
and
followed
him
many ~ crowds
*
from
-
Galilee
and
Decapolis
and
Jerusalem
and
Judea
and
beyond
the
Jordan.
~ having seen
and
the
crowds
he went up
to
the
mountain,
and
[when] he sat down
*
came
to him
the
disciples
of him.
and
opening
the
mouth
of him
he taught
them
saying,
blessed [are]
the
poor
-
in spirit,
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
blessed [are]
the ones
mourning,
for
they
will be comforted.
blessed [are]
the
humble,
for
they
will inherit
the
earth.
blessed [are]
the ones
hungering
and
thirsting
-
[for] righteousness,
for
they
will be satisfied.
blessed [are]
the
merciful,
for
they
will be shown mercy.
blessed [are]
the
pure
-
in heart,
for
they
-
~ God.
will see
blessed [are]
the
peacemakers,
for
they
sons
of god
will be called.
blessed [are]
the ones
being persecuted
because
of righteousness,
for
theirs
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
blessed
are you
when
they reproach
you
and
persecute [you]
and
speak
all [kinds of]
evil
against
you
telling lies
because
of me,
rejoice
and
be glad,
for
the
reward
of you [is]
great
in
the
heavens.
~ thus
for
they persecuted
the
prophets
-
before
you.
you
are
the
salt
of the
earth.
~ if
but
the
salt
becomes tasteless,
in
what way
will it become salty [again]?
for
nothing
it is good
[any] longer
except
*
having been thrown
out
to be trampled upon
by
-
men.
you
are
the
light
of the
world.
not
is able
a city
to be hidden
on
a mountain
lying;
nor
do they light
a lamp
and
place
it
under
the
grain bucket,
but
upon
the
lampstand,
and
it lights
all
the ones
in
the
house.
thus
let shine
the
light
of you
before
-
men,
so that
they may see
your
the
good
works
and
glorify
the
father
of you
-
in
the
heavens.
not
do think
that
I came
to abolish
the
law
or
the
prophets.
not
I did come
to abolish,
but
to fulfill.
~ truly
for
I say
to you,
until
*
may pass away
-
heaven
and
-
earth,
letter
one
or
one
stroke
by any means  
by any means  
may pass away
from
the
law,
until
*
everything
takes place.
therefore
whoever
*
breaks
one
-
commandments
of these
-
least
and
teaches
thus
-
[to] men,
~ least
he will be called
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
~ whoever
but
*
practices
and
teaches [them],
this one
~ great
will be called
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
I say
for
to you
that
unless
*
exceeds
your
-
righteousness
beyond [that]
of the
scribes
and
Pharisees,
never
*
may enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
you heard
that
it was said
to the
ancients,
you shall not ;
murder
whoever
and
might 
murder,
subject
will be ~ 
-
to judgment.
~ I
but
say
to you
-
everyone
*
being angry
with the
brother
of him
subject
will be
-
to judgment.
whoever
and
*
might say
to the
brother
of him,
raca,
subject
will be
to the
sanhedrin;
whoever
and
*
might say,
fool,
subject
will be
to 
the
gehenna (hell)
-
of fire.
~ if
therefore
you might bring
the
gift
of you
to
the
altar
and there
you remember
that
the
brother
of you
has
something
against
you,
leave
there
the
gift
of you
before
the
altar
and
go
first [and]
be reconciled
to the
brother
of you,
and
then
coming
offer
the
gift
of you.
be
well-disposed
to the
opponent
of you
quickly,
while
*
you are
with
him
on
the
road,
lest
you
might deliver
the
opponent
to the
judge
and
the
judge,
to the
official,
and
into
prison
you may be thrown.
truly
I say
to you,
you may never
*
come out
[from] there
until
*
you repay
the
last
penny.
you have heard
that
it was said,
shall not
you commit adultery.
~ I
but
say
to you
that
everyone
-
looking [upon]
a woman
with a view
-
to desire
her
already
has committed adultery
[with] her
in
the
heart
of him.
and ~ if
*
the
eye
of you
-
right
causes you to sin,
*
tear out
it
and
throw [it]
from
you.
~ it is better
for
for you
that
be lost
one
of the
members
of you
and
not
[the] whole
-
body
of you
be thrown
into
gehenna (hell).
and
if
the
right
hand ~ of you
*
causes you to sin,
*
cut off
it
and
throw [it]
from
you.
~ it is better
for
for you
that
be lost
one
of the
members
of you
and
not
[the] whole
-
body
of you
into

it was said,
and
whoever
*
divorces
the
wife
of him,
let him give
to her
a certificate of divorce.
I
but
say
to you
that
everyone
-
divorcing
the
wife
of him
except [for]
[the] matter
of fornication,
makes
her
to commit adultery,
and
whoever
*
~ a divorced woman
marries
commits adultery.
again,
you have heard
that
it was said
to the
ancients,
you shall not
break your vows
~ you shall repay
but
to the
lord
the
vows
of you.
I
but
say
to you
not
to swear
at all,
neither
by
-
heaven,
for
~ [the] throne
it is
-
of god,
nor
by
-
earth

~ [the] footstool

of him,
nor
by
Jerusalem,
for
~ [the] city

not
you are able

white
to make
or
black.
~ let

the
word
of you [be]
yes,

no.
-
but
beyond
these
from
-
evil
is.
you have heard
that
it was said,
an eye
for
an eye
and
a tooth
for
a tooth.
I
but
say
to you
not
to oppose
the
evil one,
but
whoever
[you]
hits
on
the
right
cheek
of you,
turn
to him
also
the
other;
and
to the one
wishing
~ you
to sue
and
the
shirt
of you
to take,
give
to him
also
the (your)
coat.
and
whoever
~ you [to go]
will force
~ mile,

go
with
him

[from] the one
asking
you [to] ,

the one

from
you
to borrow

turn away

that
it was said,
you shall love
the
neighbor
of you
and
you shall hate
the
enemy
of you.
~ I
but
say
to you,
love
the
enemies
of you
and
pray
for
the ones
persecuting
you,
so that
you may become
sons
of the
father
of you
-
in
[the] heavens,
for
the
sun
of him
he makes to rise
upon
evil
and
good
and
rains
upon
[the] just
and

~ if

you love

you,
what

do you have?
not
even
the
tax-collectors

and
if
you greet

what

it came about
when
finished

Jesus

words
these
were amazed
the
crowds
at
the
teaching
of him.
he was
for
teaching
them
as
authority

from

mountain
followed
him
many ~ crowds.

and
behold
a leper
having approached
worshiped
him
saying,
lord,
if
you are willing
you are able
me
to cleanse
and
having stretched out
the (his)
hand
he touched
him

I am willing,

[when] entered
now ~
he 
into

he says
to him,
I
coming
will heal
him.
and
having answered
the
centurion
said,
lord,
not
I am
worthy
that
of me
under
the
roof
you might come,
but
only
say
in a word,
and
will be healed
the
child
of me.

for
I
a man
am
under
authority,

under
myself

I say
to this one,
go,
and
he goes,
and
to another,
come,
and
he comes,
and
to the
slave
of me,
do
this,
and
he does [it].
having heard [this]
and
-
Jesus
marveled
and
said
to the ones
following,
truly
I say
to you,
with
no one
such great
faith
in
-
Israel
I have found.
I say
and
to you
that
many
from
east
and
west
will come
and
will recline at table
with
Abraham
and
Isaac

Jacob

sons
of the

will be thrown out
into
the

there
will be

weeping
and
-
grinding
of the
teeth.
and
said
-
Jesus
to the
centurion,
go,
as
you believed
let it be
for you.
and
was healed
the
child
of him
at
-
hour
that
and
coming
-
Jesus
into
the
house
of Peter,
he saw
the
mother-in-law
of him
having been bedridden
and
fever-stricken.
and
he touched
the
hand
of her,
and
left
her
the
fever,
and
she arose
and
was serving
him.

and ~ 
[when] had come
they brought
to him
demon-possessed [people].

and
he cast out
the
spirits
with a word,

all
the ones

having
he healed.
thus
was fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying,
he
the
weaknesses
of us
took
and
the
diseases [of us]
he removed.
seeing
and
-
Jesus
a crowd
around
him
commanded
to go
to
the
other side.
and
having approached
one
scribe
said
to him,
teacher,
I will follow
you
wherever
*
you go.
and
says
to him
-
Jesus,

foxes

and
of the

of him
said
to him,
Lord,

me

to go

says
to him,

me
and
permit
the

having embarked
he
into
the
boat,
followed
him
the
disciples
of him.
and
behold
a storm
great
came about
on
the
lake,
so that
the
boat
[was about] to be covered
by
the
waves,
he
but
was sleeping.
and
having approached
they aroused
him
saying,
Lord,
save [us],
we are perishing.
and
he says
to them,
why
fearful,
are you
ones of little faith?
then
arising
he rebuked
the
winds
and
the
lake,
and
there was
calm
great
the
and
men
were amazed
saying,
of what sort
is
this [man]
that
even
the
winds
and
the
lake
him
obey
and
having come
he
to
the
other side
to
the
country
of the
Gadarenes,
met
him
two
demon-possessed [men]
out
of the
tombs
coming out [who were]
dangerous,
very
so that
were not
able
some
to pass by
through

way
that
and
behold
they called out
saying,
what
to us
and
to you,
son
-
of God?
have you come
here
before
[the] time
to torture
us?
~ there was
now
far away
from
them
a herd
of  pigs
many
feeding.
the
and
demons
begged
him
saying,
if
you cast out
us,
send
us,
into
the
herd
-
of pigs.
and
he said
to them,
go away.
the ones
so
coming out
went away
into
the
pigs.
and
behold
rushed
all
the
herd
down
the
bank
into
the
lake
and
they died
in
the
waters.
the ones
but
feeding
fled,
and
having gone away
into
the
city,
they reported
everything
and
the [things]
of the ones
demon-possessed.
and
behold
all
the
city
came out
to
a meeting
-
with Jesus,
and
seeing
him
they begged
that
he might pass over
from
the
boundaries
of them.
and
having embarked
into
a boat
he crossed over
and
came
into
the (his)
own
city.
and
behold
they brought
to him
a paralytic
upon
a stretcher
lying.
and
having seen
-
Jesus
the
faith
of them,
he said
to the
paralytic,
cheer up,
child,
are forgiven
of you
the
sins.
and
behold
some
of the
scribes
said
among
themselves,
this one
\\"\\"4\\"\\
and
having seen
-
Jesus
the
thoughts
of them
said,
why
are you thinking
evil
in
the
hearts
of you?
which
for
is
easier
to say,
are forgiven
of you
the
sins,
or
to say,
rise up
and
walk?
in order that
but
you may know
that
authority
has
the
son
-
of man
on
-
earth
to forgive
sins
then
he said
to the
paralytic,
rising up,
take
of you
the
stretcher
and
go
to
the
house
of you.
and
rising up
he went away
to
the
house
of him.
~ having seen [this],
and
the
crowds
were afraid
and
glorified
-
God,
the one
having given
authority
such

to men.
and
going away
-
Jesus
from there
saw
a man
sitting
in
the
tax office,
Matthew
being called
and
he says
to him,
follow
me.
and
rising
he followed
him.
and
it came about [while]
he
was reclining at table
in
the
house,
and
behold
many
tax collectors
and
sinners
having come
reclined at table with
-
Jesus
and
with the
disciples
of him.

having seen [this]
the
Pharisees
were saying
to the

then
approached

saying,
why [do]

Pharisees
fast

the
but

of you
do not

said
to them
-

these things
he
[while] was speaking
to them
behold
ruler
one
coming
worshiped
him
saying
-
the
daughter
of me
just now;
died
but
coming
lay
the
hand
of you
upon
her,
and
she will live.
and
having arisen
-
Jesus
followed
him
also
the
disciples
of him.
and
behold
a woman
hemorrhaging
twelve
years
having approached
behind
touched
the
edge
of the
garment
of him.
she was saying
for
to 
herself,
if
only
I might touch
the
garment
of him
I will be healed.
-
and
Jesus
turning
and
seeing
her
said,
cheer up,
daughter;
the
faith
of you
has healed
you.
and
was healed
the
woman
from

hour
that
and
having come
-
Jesus
into
the
house
of the
ruler
and
having seen
the
flute players
and
the
crowd
disorderly
he was saying,
go away,
not
for
died
the
girl
but
she sleeps.
and
they were ridiculing
him.
when
but
was put out
the
crowd,
having entered
he grasped
the
hand
of her,
and
was raised
the
girl.
and
went out
-

that
and
going away
from there
-
Jesus
followed
him
two
blind [men]
crying out
and
saying,
have mercy
[on] us,
son
of David.
having come
and
into
the
house,
approached
him
the
blind [men],
and
says
to them
-
Jesus,
do you believe
that
I am able
this
to do
they say
to him,
yes,
Lord.
then
he touched
the
eyes
of them
saying,
according
to the
faith
of you
let it be done
to you.
and
were opened
their
-
eyes.
and
sternly warned
them
-
Jesus
saying,
take care,
no one
let know

but
having gone out
made known
him

that.
they
and
going out,
behold
they brought
to him
a man
mute

and
casting out
the
demons,
spoke
the
mute [man].
and
were amazed
the
crowds
saying,
never
happened
thus
in
-
Israel
the
but
Pharisees
were saying,
by
the
ruler
of the
demons
he casts out

demons.
and
went about
-
Jesus
[through] the
cities
all
and
the
villages
teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
and
preaching
the
good news
of the
kingdom
and
healing
every
disease
and
every
illness.
having seen
and
the
crowds,
he felt sympathy
for
them,
for
they were
distressed
and
weary
as
sheep
not
having
a shepherd.
then
he says
to the
disciples
of him,
the
indeed
harvest [is]
great,
the
but
workers [are]
few.
ask
therefore
the
Lord
of the
harvest
so that
he may send out
workers
into
the
harvest
of him.
and
summoning
the
twelve
disciples
of him,
he gave
to them
authority [over]
spirits
unclean
so as
to cast out
them
and
to heal
every
disease
and
every
illness.

and
it came about
when
finished
-
Jesus
giving orders
to the
twelve
disciples
of him,
he moved on
from there
-
to teach
and
to preach
in
the
cities
of them.
-
now
John
having heard
in
the
prison
the
works
of the
Christ
having sent
by way of
the
disciples
of him
said
to him,
you
are
the one
coming
or
another?
should we expect
and
answering
-
Jesus
said
to them,
going
report
to John
what
you hear
and
see.
[the] blind
receive sight
and
[the] crippled
walk,
lepers
are cleansed
and
[the] deaf
hear,
and
[the] dead
are raised
and
[the] poor
are evangelized.
and
blessed
is
whoever
*
does not
take offense
at
me.
~ [as] these ones
and
* were leaving
began
-
Jesus
to say
to the
crowds
concerning
John,
what
did you go out
into
the
wilderness
to see?
a reed
by
[the] wind
being shaken?
but
what
did you go out
to see?
a man
in
soft clothes
dressed?
behold
the ones
-
soft clothes
wearing
in
the
houses
-
of kings
are.
but
what
did you go out
to see?
a prophet?
yes,
I tell
you,
and [one]
greater than
a prophet.
this
is [he]
about
whom
it has been written,
behold
I
send
the
messenger
of me
before
[the] face
of you,
who
will prepare
the
way
of you
in front of
you.
truly
I say
to you,
not
there has arisen
among [those]
born
of women [one]
greater than
John
the
baptist.
the
but
least important
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
greater than
him
is.
from
and
the
days
of John
the
baptist
until
now,
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
is forcibly entered,
and
violent men
seize
it.
all
for
the
prophets
and
the
law
until
John
prophesied.
and
if
you are willing
to accept [it],
he
is
Elijah,
the one
about
to come.
the one
having
ears,
let that one hear.
to what
but
will I compare
-
generation?
this
like
it is
children
sitting
in
the
marketplaces
who,
calling
to the
others
say,
we played the flute
for you
and
not
you did dance
we sang a dirge
and
not
you did mourn
came
for
John
neither
eating
nor
drinking,
and
they say,
a demon.
he has
came
the
son
-
of man
eating
and
drinking,
and
they say,
behold
a man
gluttonous
and
wine-drinking,
of tax collectors
a friend
and
sinners.
and
is justified
-
wisdom
by
the
works
of her.
then
he began
to reproach
the
cities
in
which
were performed
the
majority [of the]
miracles
of him,
because
not
they did repent
woe
to you,
Chorazin,
woe
to you,
Bethsaida.
for
if
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
were performed
the
miracles,
the ones
having been performed
among
you,
long ago
-
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
they would have repented.
nevertheless,
I say
you,
for Tyre
and
Sidon
more bearable
it will be
in
[the] day
of judgment
than
for you.
and
you,
Capernaum,
not
as far as
heaven
were you lifted up?
as far as
hades
you will be brought down.
for
if
in
Sodom
had been performed
the
miracles,
the ones
having being performed
among
you,
it would have remained
-
until
-
today.
nevertheless,
I say
to you,
that
for [the] land
of Sodom
more tolerable
it will be
in
[the] day
of judgment
than
for you.
at
that
-
time
having answered
-
Jesus
said,
I praise
you,
father,
Lord
-
of heaven
and
-
earth,
because
you hid
these things
from
[the] wise
and
intelligent
and
revealed
them
to infants.
yes,
-
father,
for
thus
pleasing
it was
before
you.
all things
to me
were given
by
the
father
of me,
and
no one
knows
the
son
except
*
the
father,
nor
the
father
[does] anyone
know
except
*
the
son
and
[those] to whom
if
wishes
the
son
to reveal.
come
to
me
all
the ones
becoming weary
and
being burdened,
and I
will give rest
to you.
take up
the
yoke
of me
upon
you
and
learn
from
me,
for
humble
I am
and
lowly
in
heart,
and
you will find
rest
for the
souls
of you.
the
for
yoke
of me [is]
easy
and
the
load
of me
light
is
at
that
-
time
went
-
Jesus
on the
sabbath
through
the
grainfields.
the
and
disciples
of him
hungered
and
they began
to pick
[the] heads of wheat
and
to eat [them].
the
but
Pharisees,
seeing [this]
said
to him,
behold
the
disciples
of you
are doing
what
not
is permitted
to do
on
[the] Sabbath
he
but
said
to them,
not
have you read
what
did
David
when
he hungered
and
the ones
with
him,
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of god
and
the
bread
of the
presentation
ate,
which
not
was permissible
*
for him
to eat
nor
for the ones
with
him,
except
*
for the
priests
alone?
or
not
have you read
in
the
law
that
on the
sabbaths
the
priests
in
the
temple
the
sabbath
desecrate
and
innocent
are?
I say
but
to you
that
the
temple
[something] greater than
is
here.
if
but
you had known
what
this means,
mercy
I desire
and
not
sacrifice,
not
would
you have condemned
the
innocent.
Lord
for
is
of the
sabbath
the
son
-
of man.
and
having gone
from there
he came
into
the
synagogue
of them
and
behold
a man
hand
having
a withered.
and
they questioned
him
asking,
if
it is permissible
on the
sabbaths
to heal?
in order that
they might accuse
him.
he
but
said
to them,
what
will there be
among
you
man
who
will have
sheep
one
and
if
falls
this one
on the
sabbaths
into
a pit,
not
will take hold of
it
and
raise [it] up?
how much more
therefore
valuable is
a man
than a sheep.
for this reason
it is permissible
on the
sabbaths
good
to do
then
he says
to the
man,
stretch out
your
-
hand
and
he stretched [it] out
and
it was restored
healthy
as
the
other.
having gone
and
the
Pharisees
counsel
took
against
him
so that
him.
they might destroy
-
but
Jesus
knowing [this]
departed
from there.
and
followed
him
crowds
many
and
he healed
them
all
and
he warned
them
that
not
manifest
him
they should make,
that
might be fulfilled
the thing
spoken
through
Isaiah
the
prophet
saying,
behold
the
servant
of me
whom
I chose,
the
beloved
of me
in
whom
was well pleased
the
soul
of me
I will put
the
spirit
of me
upon
him,
and
judgment
to the
nations
he will proclaim.
not
he will quarrel
nor
shout,
nor
will hear
anyone
in
the
streets
the
voice
of him.
a reed
being crushed
not
he will break
and
a lamp wick
smoking
not
he will extinguish
until
*
he leads
to
victory
-
justice.
and
in the
name
of him
[the] gentiles
will hope.
then
was brought
to him
a demon-possessed [man who was]
blind
and
mute,
and
he healed
him
so that
the
mute [man was able]
to speak
and
to see.
and
were amazed
all
the
crowds
and
they were saying,
surely
this one
is [not]
the
son
of David [is he]?
the
but
Pharisees
having heard [this]
said,
this one
not
does cast out
-
demons
except
*
by
-
Beelzeboul,
[the] ruler
of the
demons.
knowing
but
the
thoughts
of them
he said
to them,
every
kingdom
having been divided
against
itself
is laid waste,
and
every
city
or
house
having been divided
against
itself
not
will stand
and
if
-
Satan
-
Satan,
casts out
against
himself
his is divided.
how
therefore
will stand
the
kingdom
of him?
and
if
I
by
Beelzeboul
cast out
the
demons,
[do] the
sons
of you
by
whom
cast [them] out?
therefore,
*
they
judges
will be
of you.
if
but
by
[the] spirit
of God
I
cast out
the
demons,
then
has arrived
upon
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
or
how
is able
someone
to enter
into
the
house
of the
stong one
and
the
furnishings
of him
steal,
unless
*
first
he binds
the
stong one?
and
then
the
house
of him
he will plunder.
the one
not
being
with
me
against
me
is,
and
the one
not
gathering
with
me

therefore,
*
I say
to you,
every
sin
and
blasphemy
will be forgiven
-
men,
-
but
the
spirit
blasphemy [against]
not
will be forgiven
and
whoever

speaks
a word
against
the

it will be forgiven
him.

of the
good
treasure

good,
and
the
evil
man
out of
the
evil
treasure
brings forth
evil.
i say
but
to you
that
every
~ word
careless
which
speak
-
men
they will give
concerning
it
an account
on
[the] day
of judgment;
by
for
the
words
of you
you will be justified,
and
by
the
words
of you
you will be condemned.
then
answered
him
some
of the
scribes
and
Pharisees
saying,
teacher,
we desire
from
you
a sign.
to see
-
but
having answered
he said
to them,
a generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign,
seeks
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
except
*
the
sign
of Jonah
the
prophet.
just as
for
was
Jonah ~
in
the
belly
of the
sea monster
three
days
and
three
nights,
so
will be
the
son
-
of man
in
the
heart
of the
earth
three
days
and
three
nights.
[the] men
of Nineveh
will stand up
at
the
judgment
with
-
generation
this
and
they will condemn
it,
for
they repented
at
the
preaching
of Jonah,
and
behold
[something] much greater than
Jonah [is]
here.
[the] queen
of [the] south
will be raised
at
the
judgment
with
-
generation
this
and
will condemn
it,
for
she came
from
the
ends
of the
earth
to listen to
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold
[something] much greater than
Solomon [is]
here.
when
now
the
unclean
spirit
goes out
from
the
man,
it goes
through
dry
places
seeking
a resting place
and
not
it does find [one].
then
it says,
into
the
house
of me
I will return
from where
I came out.
and
having come
it finds [the house]
standing empty
having been swept
and
having been put in order.
then
it goes
and
takes along
with
itself
seven
other
spirits
more evil than
itself
and
having entered [the house]
it sets up residence
there.
and
becomes
the
last [state]
-
of man
that
worse
than the
first.
thus
it will be
as well
-
generation
with this
-
evil.
while
he
was still speaking
to the
crowds
behold
the
mother
and
the
brothers
of him
stood
outside
seeking
with him.
to speak
said
and
someone
to him,
behold
the
mother
of you
and
the
brothers
of you
outside
have stood
seeking
with you
to speak
-
and
having answered
he said
to the one
speaking
with him,
who
is
the
mother
of me
and
who
are
the
brothers
of me?
and
stretching out
the
hand
of him
upon
the
disciples
of him
he said,
behold
the
mother
of me
and
the
brothers
of me.
whoever
for
*
does
the
will
of the
father
of me,
the one
in
[the] heavens,
he
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
is.
on
-
day
that
having gone out
-
Jesus
of the
house,
he sat
beside
the
lake.
and
gathered together
to
him
crowds,
many
so that
he
into
a boat
got in
to sit down,
and
entire
the
crowd
along
the
shore
stood.
and
he told
them
many things
in
parables
saying,
behold
went out
the
sower
-
to sow [seed].
and
* while ~
*
sowed
he
this one
some
fell
along
the
road.
and
having come
the
birds
devoured
them.
others
but
fell
upon
the
rocky places
where
it does not have
have
soil
much
and
immediately
it sprang up
on account of
the
not
having
depth
of soil.
[the] Sun
and
having arisen
it was scorched
and
because
*
it did not
have
a root
it withered.
others
and
fell
among
the
thorns,
and
grew up
the
thorns
and
choked
them.
others
but
fell
on
the
earth
-
good
and
they yielded
fruit,
the one
*
one hundred,
the other
*
sixty,
the other
*
thirty.
the one
having
ears
let that one hear.
and
approaching
the
disciples
said
to him,
why
*
in
parables
are  you speaking
to them?
-
and
having answered
he said
to them,
because
to you
it has been granted
to know
the
mysteries
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens,
to those
but
not
it has been granted
whoever
for
has,
[more] will be given
to him
and
he will have an abundance.
whoever
but
does not
have
even
what
he has
will be taken
from
him.
for this reason
*
in
parables
to them,
I am speaking
for
[while] seeing
not
they do see
and
[while] hearing
not
they do hear
nor
do they understand.
and
is fulfilled
in them
the
prophecy
of Isaiah
-
saying,
in hearing
you will hear
and
by no means
*
understand
and
[while] seeing
you will see
and
by no means
*
perceive
has been made dull
for
the
heart
-
people,
of this
and
with
[their] ears
with difficulty
they hear
and
the
eyes
of them
are closed,
lest
they see
with the (their)
eyes
and
with the (their)
ears
they hear
and
with the
heart
they understand
and
they turn
and
I will heal
them.
of you
but
[are] blessed
the
eyes
for
they see
and
the
ears
of you
for
they  hear.
truly
for
I say
to you
that
many
prophets
and
righteous ones
desired
to see
what
you see
and
not
they did see
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
they did hear [it]
you
therefore
listen to
the
parable
of the
sower.
[when] anyone
hearing
the
word
of the
kingdom
and
not
understanding [it],
comes
the
evil one
and
seizes
the [thing]
having been sown
in
the
heart
of him,
this one
is [like]
the [seed]
along
the
path
being sown.
the [seed]
and
upon
the
rocky places
being sown,
this one
is [like]
the one
the
word
listening to
and
immediately
with
joy
receiving
it,
no
he has
but
root
in
himself,
but
transitory,
is
[when] coming
but
tribulation
or
persecution
on account of
the
word,
immediately
he falls away.
the [seed]
and
among
the
thorns
being sown,
this one
is
the one
the
word
listening to,
and
the
anxiety
of the
age
and
the
deceit
-
of riches
choke
the
word
and
unfruitful.
it becomes
the [seed]
but
upon
the
good
soil
being sown,
this one
is
the one
the
word
listening to
and
understanding [it],
who
indeed
bears fruit
and
produces
the one
*
a hundred,
the other
*
sixty,
the other
*
thirty.
another
parable
he placed before
them
saying,
is like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man
having sown
good
seed
in
the
field
of him.
while
but
*
slept
the
men
came
of him
the
enemy
and
sowed afterward
weeds
in 
the midst
of the
wheat
and
went away.
when
and
sprouted
the
grass
and
fruit
it produced
then
appeared
also
the
weeds.
having approached
and
the
slaves
of the
master of the house
said
to him,
lord,
not
good
seed
did you sow
in
-
your
field?
from where
then
have
[the] weeds [come]?
he
and
said
to them,
an enemy
man
this
did
the
so
slaves
say
to him,
do you want
then
[as] we go [that]
we collect
them?
he
but
said,
no,
lest
[while] gathering
the
weeds
you uproot
together
with them
the
wheat.
permit
to grow together
both
until
the
harvest,
and
at
[the] time
of the
harvest
I will say
to the
reapers,
collect
first
the
weeds
and
tie
them
into
bundles
* in order to
*
* burn
them,
the
but
wheat
gather
into
the
storehouse
of me.
another
parable
he placed before
them
saying,
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a seed,
mustard
which
taking
a man
planted
in
the
field
of him,
which
smaller than
indeed
is
all
of the
seeds,
when
but
it grows,
larger than
the
garden vegetables
it is
and
it becomes
a tree,
so that
to come
the
birds
-
of heaven
and
to live
in
the
branches
of it.
another
parable
he placed before
them:
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
leaven,
which
having taken
a woman
hid
in
of wheat flour
measures
three
until
*
it leavened
[the] whole.
these things
all
spoke
-
Jesus
in
parables
to the
crowds
and
apart from
parables
not
he did speak
to them,
so that
might  be fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
the
prophet
saying,
I will open
with
parables
the
mouth
of me,
I will utter
things having been hidden
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world.
then
having sent away
the
crowds
he came
into
the
house.
and
approached
him
the
disciples
of him
saying,
explain
to us
the
parable
of the
weeds
of the
field.
he
and
having answered
said,
the  one
sowing
the
good
seed
is
the
son
-
of man,
the
and
field
is
the
world,
the
and
good
seed
these
are
the
sons
of the
kingdom.
the
but
weeds
are
the
sons
of the
evil [one],
the
and
enemy - the one
*
having sown
them
is
the
devil,
the
and
harvest
[the] end
of [the] age
is,
the
and
reapers
angels.
are
just as
therefore
are gathered together
the
weeds
-
by fire,
to be consumed
so also
it will be
at
the
end
of the
age.
will send out
the
son
-
of man
the
angels
of him,
and
they will gather together
from
the
kingdom
of him
all
the
offensive things
and
the ones
practicing
-
lawlessness
and
they will throw
them
into
the
furnace
-
of fire.
in that place
there will be
-
weeping
and
-
grinding
of the
teeth.
then
the
righteous ones
will shine
as
the
sun
in
the
kingdom
of the
father
of them.
the one
having
ears
let that one hear.
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
* treasure
* a  ~ having been  hidden
in
the
field,
which
having found
a man
hid,
and
from
the
joy
of him
goes away
and
sells
everything
which
he has
and
buys
-
field.
that
again
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man
merchant
seeking
fine
pearls.
having found
and
one
valuable
pearl,
having gone away
sold
everything
which
he had
and
bought
it.
again
like
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a net
having been cast
into
the
lake
and
from
every
kind
it gathered.
which
when
it was filled
having been pulled up
on
the
shore
and
having sat down
they collected
the
good things
into
a container,
the
and
rotten things
out
they threw
thus
it will be
at
the
end
of the
age.
will go out
the
angels
and
they will separate
the
evil [ones]
from
among
the
righteous [ones]
and
they will throw
them
into
the
furnace
-
of fire.
in that place
there will be
-
weeping
and
-
grinding
of the
teeth.
did you understand
these things?
all
they say
to him,
yes.
he
so
said
to them,
therefore
*
every
scribe
having become a disciple
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens
like
is
a man [who is]
a house master,
who
takes out
of
the
treasure
of him
new
and
old.
and
it came about
when
finished
-
Jesus
-
parables, [that]
these
he went away
from there.
and
having come
into
the
hometown
of him
he taught
them
in
the
synagogue
of them,
so as
to be amazed
them
and
to say,
from where [did it come]
to this one
-
wisdom
this
and
the
miracles?
not
this
is
the
-
carpenters
son?
[is] not
the
mother
of him
called
Mary
and
the
brothers
of him
James
and
Joses (or Joseph)
and
Simon
and
Judas?
and
the
sisters
of him
not
all
with
us
are?
from where
therefore [came]
to this one
these things?
all
and
they were taking offense
at
him.
-
but
Jesus
said
to them,
not
is
a prophet
dishonored
except
*
in
his
country
and
in
the
house
of him.
and
not
he did perform
in that place
miracles
many
because of
the
unbelief
of them.
at
that
-
time
heard
Herod
the
tetrarch
the
report
of Jesus,
and
he said
to the
servants
of him,
this one
is
John
the
baptist.
he
has risen
from
the
dead
and
for this reason
*
the
powers
are working
in
him.
-
for
Herod
having arrested
-
John
bound
him
and
in
prison
he put [him] away
because
Herodias
the
wife
of Philip,
the
brother
of him.
was saying
for
-
John
to him,
not
it is permissible
for you
to have
her.
and
[although] desiring
him
to kill
he feared
the
crowd,
because
as
a prophet
* him.
* they considered ~
* at the birthday celebration
* now ~
it came about [that]
-
of Herod
danced
the
daughter
-
of Herodias
in
the
midst [of them]
and
it pleased
-
Herod.
therefore
with
an oath
he promised
to her
to give
whatever
*
she wished.
she
so
having been prompted
by
the
mother
of her,
give
to me,
she said,
here
upon
a platter
the
head
of John
the
baptist.
and
[although] grieving
the
king
on account of
the
oaths
and
the
fellow guests
he commanded [it]
to be given,
and
having sent
he beheaded
-
John
in
-
prison.
and
was brought
the
head
of him
upon
a platter
and
it was given
to the
girl,
and
she gave [it]
to the
mother
of her.
and
having approached
the
disciples
of him
they carried
the
corpse
and
buried
him
and
having come
they reported [it]
-
to Jesus.
having heard [this]
and
-
Jesus
withdrew
from there
in
a boat
to
a desolate
place
by himself.
*
and
having heard [this]
the
crowds
followed
him
by land
from
the
cities.
and
having gone out
he saw
a great
crowd
and
he felt compassion
for
them
and
healed

sick

* [when] evening
now ~
having come,
came
to him
the
disciples
saying,

the
hour

the
crowds,
so that
having gone out
into
the
villages
they may buy

-
but
Jesus
said
to them,
no

to go out,
give
to them

to eat.
they
but

to him,
not

having commanded
the

to recline
on
the
grass,
[and] having taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish,
[and] having looked up
to
-

he blessed [them]
and
having broken [them]
he gave
to the

the
loaves,
the
and

to the

and
ate
everyone
and
they were satisfied,
and
they carried up
the
leftovers
of the
fragments,
twelve
baskets
full.
the ones
and
eating
were
men
about
five thousand
apart from
[the] women
and

and
immediately
he compelled
the
disciples
to enter
into
the
boat
and
to go before
him
to
the
other side,
until

he might send away
the
crowds.
and

in [the] fourth

the ones
and
in
the
boat
worshiped
him
saying,
truly
god's
son
you are.
and
having crossed over
they came
onto
the
land
at
Gennesaret.
and
having recognized
him,
the
men

sent
into

and
they brought
to him
all

they were appealing
to him
that

as many as
he touched
they were cured.

to them,

and
you nullify

to them,

to him,

he
and
said,

these
are
the things
defiling
the

defile
the
man.
and
having gone out
from there
-
Jesus
withdrew
into
the
districts
of Tyre
and
Sidon.
and
behold
a woman
Canaanite
from
-
borders
those
having come out
was crying out
saying,
have mercy
on me,
lord,
son
of David.
the
daughter
of me
severely
is demon-possessed.
he
but
did not
answer
her
a word.
and
having approached
the
disciples
of him
were asking
him
saying,
send away
her,
for
she cries out
after
us.
he
but
having answered
said,
not
I was sent
except
*
to
the
sheep
-
lost
of [the] house
of Israel.
she
but
having come
was worshiping
him
saying,
lord,
help
me.
he
but
having answered
said,
not
it is
good
to take
the
bread
of the
children
and
to throw [it]
to the
dogs.
she
but
said,
yes
lord,
even
for
the
dogs
eat
from
the
crumbs
-
falling
from
the
table
of the
masters
of them.
then
having answered
-
Jesus
said
to her,
o
woman,
great [is]
your
-
faith.
let it be done
for you
as
you desire.
and
was healed
the
daughter
of her
from
-
hour
that
and
having passed over
from there
-
Jesus
came
beside
the
lake
-
of Galilee,
and
having gone up
to
the
mountain
he was sitting
there.
and
approached
him
crowds
great
having
with
them
lame,
blind,
crippled,
mute,
and
others
many
and
they laid
them
at
the
feet
of him,
and
he healed
them,
so as
the
crowd
to amaze
seeing
mutes
speaking,
cripples
healthy
and
lame
walking around
and
blind
seeing.
and
they glorified
the
god
of Israel.
-
and
Jesus
having summoned
the
disciples
of him
said,
I feel compassion
for
the
crowd,
for
already
days
three
they remain
with me
and
not
they do have
anything
they may eat.
and
to send away
them
hungry
not
I do wish
lest
they become weary
on
the
way.
and
say
to him
the
disciples,
from where
[is there to come] to us
in
[the] wilderness
loaves
so many
so as
to feed
crowd?
such a great
and
says
to them
-
Jesus,
how many
loaves
do you have?
-
and
they said,
seven
and
a few
fish.
and
having given orders
to the
crowd
to recline
on
the
ground,
he took
the
seven
loaves
and
the
fish
and
having given thanks
he broke [them]
and
gave [them]
to the
disciples,
the
and
disciples [gave them]
to the
crowds.
and
ate
everyone
and
they were satisfied.
and
the
leftovers
of the
fragments
gather
seven
baskets
full.
the ones
and
eating
were
four thousand
men
apart from
[the] women
and
children.
and
having sent away
the
crowds
he entered
into
the
boat
and
came
into
the
borders
of Magadan.
and
having approached
the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees
testing
asked
him
a sign
from
-
heaven
to show
them.
he
but
having answered
said
to them,
[when]  evening
having come
you say,
fair weather,
is fiery red
for
the
sky.
and
in the morning,
today
stormy weather,
is fiery red
for
being over cast
the
sky.
the
-
appearance
of the
sky.
you know [enough]
to distinguish,
the
but
signs
of the
times
not
can you make out
a generation
evil
and
adulterous
a sign,
demands
and
a sign
not
will be given
to it
except
*
the
sign
of Jonah,
and
having left
them
he went away.
and
having come
the
disciples
to
the
other side,
they forgot
loaves.
to take
-
but
Jesus
said
to them,
take care
and
beware
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
the Sadducees.
they
but
were reasoning
among
themselves
saying
-
bread
not
we did take
* having known [their thoughts]
* but ~
-
Jesus
said,
why
are you reasoning
among
yourselves,
ones of little faith, [saying]
-
bread
no
you have
not yet
do you understand
nor
remember
the
five
loaves
of the
five thousand
and
how many
baskets
you took [up]?
nor
the
seven
loaves
of the
four thousand
and
how many
baskets
you took [up]?
how
not
you can understand
that
not
concerning
loaves
I spoke
to you?
beware
but
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees.
then
they understood
that
not
he did say
to beware
of
the
leaven
of the
loaves,
but
of
the
teaching
of the
Pharisees
and
Sadducees.
having come
and
-
Jesus
into
the
region
of Caesarea
-
Philippi
he was questioning
the
disciples
of him
saying,
whom
saying,
the
men
to be
the
son
-
of man?
-
and
they said,
some [say]
-
John
the
baptist,
others
but
Elijah,
others
and
Jeremiah
or
one
of the
prophets.
he says
to them,
you
but
who
me
do you consider
to be?
having answered
and
Simon
Peter
said,
you
are
the
Christ,
the
son
-
God
of the
living.
having answered
and
-
Jesus
said
to him,
blessed
are you,
Simon
Bar-Jona,
for
flesh
and
blood
not
did reveal [this]
to you
but
the
father
of me
the one
in
the
heavens.
I also
and
to you
say
that
you
are
Peter (rock),
and
upon
this
-
rock
I will build
of me
the
church
and
[the] gates
of hades
not
will overcome
it.
I will give
to you
the
keys
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens,
and
whatever
*
you may have bound
upon
the
earth
it will
have been bound
in
the
heavens,
and
whatever
*
you may have abolished
upon
the
earth
it will
have been abolished
in
the
heavens.
then
he gave orders
to the
disciples
that
no one
they should tell
that
he
is
the
Christ.
from
that point
began
-
Jesus
to explain
to the
disciples
of him
that
it is necessary
for him
to
Jerusalem
to go
and
many things
to suffer
from
the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
on the
third
day
to be raised.
and
having taken
him [aside]
-
Peter
began
to rebuke
him
saying,
may [God] be gracious
to you,
Lord.
never
never
will happen
to you
this.
he
but
having turned around
said
-
to Peter,
get
behind
me,
Satan.
a stumbling block
you are
to me,
for
not
you are thinking
the things
-
of God
but
the things
-
of men.
then
-
Jesus
said
to the
disciples
of him,
if
someone
wishes
after
me
to come,
let him deny
himself
and
take up
the
cross
of him
and
let [him] follow
me.
whoever
for
*
desires
the
soul
of him
to save
will lose
it.
whoever
but
*
loses
the
soul
of him
on account
of me
will find
it.
what
for
will be benefited
a man
if
the
world
whole
he acquires
the
but
soul
of him
he forfeits?
or
what
will give
a man
in exchange for
the
soul
of him?
is about
for
the
son
-
of man
to come
in
the
glory
of the
father
of him
with
the
angels
of him,
and
then
he will recompense
each one
according to
the
actions
of him.
truly
I say
to you
that
there are
some
of the ones
here
standing
who
will in no way
*
taste
death
until
*
they see
the
son
-
of man
coming
with
the
kingdom
of him.
and
after
days
six
took
-
Jesus
-
Peter
and
James
and
John
the
brother
of him
and
he brings up
them
to
a mountain
high
privately,
*
and
he was transfigured
before
them,
and
shone
the
face
of him
like
the
sun,
the
and
garments
of him
became
brilliant
as
the
light.
and
behold
appeared
to them
Moses
and
Elijah
talking
with
him.
having answered
and
-
Peter
said
-
to Jesus,
lord,
good
it is
for us
here
to be
if
you wish,
I will make
here
three
tents,
for you
one
and
for Moses
one
and
for Elijah.
one
while
he
is speaking
behold
a cloud
shining
overshadowed
them,
and
behold
a voice
from
the
cloud
speaking,
this
is
the
son
of me,
the
beloved,
in
whom
I am well pleased.
listen
to him.
and
having heard [this]
the
disciples
fell
upon
[the] face[s]
of them
and
they were terrified
greatly.
and
approached
-
Jesus
and
having touched
them
he said,
arise
and
do not
be afraid
having lifted
and
the
eyes
of them
no one
they saw
except
*
himself
Jesus
only.
and
[as][were] coming down
they
from
the
mountain
commanded
them
-
Jesus
saying,
no one
tell
the
vision
until
*
the
son
-
of man
from
[the] dead
has been raised.
and
asked
him
the
disciples
saying,
why
therefore [do]
the
scribes
say
that
for Elijah
it is necessary
to come
first?
he
and
having answered
said,
Elijah
indeed
is coming
and
will restore
all things.
I say
but
to you
that
Elijah
already
came,
and
not
they did recognize
him
but
did
with
him
whatever
they wished.
thus
also
the
son
-
of man
is about
to suffer
by
them.
then
understood
the
disciples
that
about
John
the
baptist
he spoke
to them.
and
having come
to
the
crowd,
came
to him
a man
kneeling down [before]
him
and
saying,
lord,
have mercy on
my
-
son,
for
he is an epileptic
and
terribly.
suffers
often
for
he falls
into
the
fire
and
often
into
the
water.
and
I brought
him
to the
disciples
of you,
and
not
they were able
him
to heal
having answered
and
-
Jesus
said
o
generation
faithless
and
depraved,
how long
*
with
you
will I be?
how long
*
will I endure
you?
bring
to me
him
here.
and
rebuked
it
-
Jesus
and
came out
from
him
the
demon
and
was healed
the
child
from
-
hour
that
then
having approached
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
privately
*
they said,
why
*
[were] we
not
able
to cast out
it?
he
and
says
to them,
on account of
the
little faith
of you.
truly
for
I say
to you,
if
you have
faith
like
a seed
mustard
you will say
-
to mountain
this
move
from
there,
and
it will be moved.
and
nothing
will be impossible
for you.
[after] coming together
and
they
in
-
Galilee,
said
to them
-
Jesus,
is about
the
son
-
of man
to be betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men,
and
they will kill
him,
and
on the
third
day
he will be raised.
and
they grieved
greatly.
having come
and
they
into
Capernaum,
approached
the ones
the
two-drachma piece
receiving
-
to Peter
and
they said,
the
teacher
of you,
not
does he pay
the
two-drachma piece [tax]?
he says,
yes.
and
having come
into
the
house
anticipated
him
-
Jesus
saying,
what
to you,
seems [right]
Simon?
the
kings
of the
earth,
from
whom
do they receive
a tax
or
[the] poll tax?
from
the
sons
of them
or
from
-
strangers?
having spoken,
and
from
the
strangers.
said
to him
-
Jesus,
then
*
exempt
are
the
sons.
in order that
but
not
we may offend
them,
having gone
to
[the] lake
cast
a fishhook
and
the
having come up
first
fish
take,
and
having opened
the
mouth
of it
you will find
a stater.
~ that
having taken
give
to them
on behalf of
me
and
you.
at
that
-
hour
approached
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
saying,
who
then
greatest
is
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens?
and
having called
a child
he set
him
in
[the] midst
of them
and
said,
truly
I say
to you,
unless
*
you change
and
you become
like
-
children,
you will never
*
enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
whoever
therefore
will humble
himself
like
-
child
this
this one
is
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
and
whoever
*
may receive
one
a child
such
in
the
name
of me,
me
receives
whoever
and
*
causes to fall
one
-
little ones
of these
-
believing
in
me,
it is better
for him
that
be hung
[the] millstone
of a donkey
around
the
neck
of him
and
he be drowned
in
the
depth
of the
sea.
woe
to the
world
because of
the
offenses.
[it is] necessary
for
to come
the
offenses,
but
woe
to the
man
through
whom
the
offense
comes.
if
and
the
hand
of you
or
the
foot
of you
causes to fall
you
cut off
it
and
throw [it]
from
you.
better
for you
it is
to enter
into
-
life
crippled
or
lame
than
two
hands
or
two
feet
having
to be thrown
into
the
fire
-
eternal.
and
if
the
eye
of you
causes  to fall,
you
take out
it
and
throw [it]
from
you.
better
for you
it is
one ~ eyed
into
-
life
to enter
than
two
eyes
having
to be cast
into
the
gehenna ( hell)
-
of fire.
see [to it that]
do not
you look down upon
one
-
little ones
of these
I say
for
to you
that
the
angels
of them
in
[the] heavens
continually
*
see
the
face
of the
father
of me,
the one
in
[the] heavens.
what
to you?
seems [right]
if
belonged
to any
man
one hundred
sheep
and
wandered
one
of
them,
not
will he leave
the
ninety - nine
*
on
the
hillsides
and
having gone
seek
the one
having wandered?
and
if
he happens
to find
it,
truly
I say
to you
that
he rejoices
over
it
more
than
over
the
ninety - nine
*
which
not
have been wandering
thus
not
it is
[the] will
before
the
father
of you
the one
in
[the] heavens
that
should perish
one
-
little ones.
of these
if
and
sins
against
you
the
brother
of you.
go [and]
reprove
him
between
you
and
he
alone
if
you
he hears
you gained
the
brother
of you.
if
but
not
he does listen
take
with
you
still
one
or
two,
that
by
[the] mouth
of two
witnesses
or
three
may be established
every
word.
if
but
he refuses to hear
them,
speak
to the
church.
if
and
even
the
church
he refuses to hear,
let him be
to you
as
the
gentile
and
the
tax collector.
truly
I say
to you.
whatever
*
you bind
on
the
earth
will
have been bound
in
heaven,
and
whatever
*
you abolish
upon
the
earth
will have
been abolished
in
heaven.
again
truly
I say
to you
that
if
two
will be in agreement
of
you
upon
the
earth
concerning
every
matter
whatever
*
they will ask,
it will be done
for them
by
the
father
of me
the one
in
[the] heavens.
where
for
there are
two
or
three
having been gathered
in
-
my
name,
there
I am
in
[the] midst
of them.
then
having approached
-
Peter
said
to him,
Lord,
how often
will sin
against
me
the
brother
of me
and
I will forgive
him?
as many as
seven times?
says
to him
-
Jesus,
not
I do say
to you
as many as
seven
but
as many as
seventy times
seven.
therefore,
*
is like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man,
a king,
who
wished
to settle
accounts
with
the
slaves
of him.
having begun
and
he
to settle [accounts]
was brought
to him
one
debtor
of ten thousand
talents.
not
having
but
him
to repay
commanded
him
the
Lord
to be sold
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
everything
which
he has,
and
to be repaid.
falling
therefore
the
slave
did homage before
him
saying,
have patience
with
me
and
everything
I will pay back
to you.
having had compassion
and
the
Lord
-
slave
of that
pardoned
him
and
the
loan
forgave
him.
having gone out
and
-
slave
that
found
one
of the
fellow slaves
of him,
who
owed
him
one hundred
denarii,
and
having seized
him
was choking [him]
saying,
repay
if
something.
you owe [me]
having fallen
therefore
the
fellow slave
of him
begged
him
saying,
have patience
with
me,
and
I will repay
you.
he
but
not
was willing
but
having left
he threw
him
into
prison
until
he should repay
that which
is owning.
having seen
therefore
the
fellow slaves
of him
the things
having taken place
they grieved
greatly
and
having come
they reported
to the
Lord
of them
all
the things
having taken place.
then
having called
him
the
Lord
of him
says
to him,
slave
wicked
all
-
debt
that
I forgave
you,
because
you begged
me.
not
was it necessary
also
for you
to have mercy upon
the
fellow slave
of you
as
I also
on you?
had mercy
and
having been angry
the
Lord
of him
handed over
him
to the
jailers
until
*
he should repay
everything
-
owing.
thus
also
the
father
of me
-
heavenly
will do
to you,
unless
*
you forgive
each one
the
brother
of him
from
the
hearts
of you.
and
it came to pass
when
finished
-
Jesus
-
words
these
he departed
from
-
Galilee
and
came
into
the
regions
-
of Judea
beyond
the
Jordan.
and
followed
him
a great ~ crowd,
*
and
he healed
them
there.
and
approached
him
[the] Pharisees
tempting
him
and
saying,
if
it is permissible
for a man
to divorce
the
wife
of him
for
[any and] every
reason?
he
but
having answered
said,
not
have you read
that
the one
having created
from
[the] beginning
male
and
female
made
them?
and
he said,
because of
this
will leave
a man
the (his)
father
and
the (his)
mother
and
will be joined
to the
wife
of him,
and
will be
the
two
-
flesh.
one
so
no longer
they are
two
but
flesh
one
whatever
therefore
-
God
joined together
a man
let not
divide
they say
to him,
why
then
Moses
did command
to give
a certificate
of divorce
and
to divorce
[her]?
he says
to them
that
Moses
because
the
hardness of heart
of you
permitted
you
to divorce
the
wives
of you,
from
the beginning
however
it was not
it was
thus.
I say
but
to you
that
whoever
*
divorces
the
wife
of him
not
based on
fornication
and
marries
another
commits adultery.
say
to him
the
disciples
of him,
if
thus
is
the
case
of the
man
with
the
wife,
not
it is advantageous
to marry.
he
*but
said
to them,
not
everyone
is able to comprehend
-
word
this
but [those]
to whom
it has been given.
there are
for
eunuchs
who
from
[the] womb
of [their] mother
were born
thus,
and
there are
eunuchs
who
were made eunuchs
by
-
men,
and
there are
eunuchs
who
make eunuchs
of themselves
on account
of the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
the one
being able
to comprehend [this]
let him comprehend.
then
was brought
to him
children
that
the (his)
hands
he might put on
them
and
to pray.
the
however
disciples
rebuked
them.
-
but
Jesus
said,
permit
the
children
and
do not
forbid
them
to come
to
me,
-
for
of such ones
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
and
having placed
the (his)
hands
on them
he departed
from there.
and
behold
one
having approached
to him
said,
teacher,
what
good
may I do
that
I may have
life
eternal
he
and
said
to him,
why
me
do you ask
about
the
good?
one
is
-
good.
if
but
you wish
into
-
life
to enter,
keep
the
commandments.
he says
to him,
which?
-
and
Jesus
said,
-
not
* you shall murder,
not
* you shall  commit adultery,
*not
* you shall steal,
*not
* you shall bear false witness,
honor
the (your)
father
and
the (your)
mother,
and,
you shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself.
says
to him
the
young man,
all
these things
I followed.
what
still
am I lacking?
said
to him
-
Jesus,
if
you wish
perfect,
to be
to [and]
sell
your
-
possessions
and
give
to the
poor,
and
you will have
treasure
in
[the] heavens,
and
come
follow
me.
having heard
but
the
young man
the
word
went away
grieving,
he was
for
having
possessions.
many ~
-
and
Jesus
said
to the
disciples
of him,
truly
I say
to you
that
a rich person
with difficulty
will enter
into
the
kingdom
of the
heavens.
again
and
I say
to you,
easier
it is
[for] a camel
through
[the] eye
of a needle
to go through
than [for]
a rich person
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of god.
having heard [this]
and
the
disciples
were amazed
greatly
saying,
who
then
is able
to be saved?
having looked upon [them]
and
-
Jesus
said
to them,
with
men
this
impossible,
is
with
but
god
all things [are]
possible.
then
having answered
-
Peter
said
to him,
behold
we
left
everthing
and
followed
you.
what
then
will be
to us?
-
and
Jesus
said
to them,
truly
I say
to you
that
you
the ones
having followed
me,
in
the
new world,
when
sits
the
son
-
of man
upon
[the] throne
of glory
of him,
will sit
also
you
upon
twelve
thrones
judging
the
twelve
tribes
-
of Esrael.
and
anyone
who
left
home
or
brothers
or
sisters
or
father
or
mother
or
children
or
lands
on account of
the
name
of me,
a hundred times
will receive
and
life
eternal
will inherit.
many
and
will be
[who are]  first
last
and
[the] last
first.
like
for
is
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man
a master of the house,
who
went out
went out
early in the morning
to hire
workers
for
the
vineyard
of him.
having agreed
and
with
the
workers
for
a denarius
[for] the
day,
he sent
them
into
the
vineyard
of him.
and
having gone out
around
[the] third
hour
he saw
others
having stood
in
the
marketplace
idle,
and
to those
he said,
go
also
you
into
the
vineyard,
and
whatever
*
may be [considered]
right
I will give
to you.
-
and
they left.
again
*and
having gone out
around
[the] sixth
and
[the] ninth
hour
he did
likewise.
around
and
the
eleventh [hour]
having gone out
he found
others
having stood
and
he says
to them,
why
* here
* have you been standing ~
all
the
day
idle?
they say
to him,
because
no one
us
hired
he says
to them,
go
also
you
into
the
vineyard
* [when] evening
* and ~
* having come
says
the
owner
of the
vineyard
to the
foreman
of him.
call
the
workers
and
give
to them
the
wage
having begun
with
the
last ones
until
the
first.
and
having come
the ones
around
the
eleventh
hour
they received
each
a denarius.
and
having come
the
first ones
they thought
that
* a larger sum;
* they would receive ~
and
they received
-
each
a denarius
also
themselves.
* having received [the denarius]
* and ~
they were complaining
against
the
house master
saying,
these
-
last ones
one
hour
worked,
and
equal
to us
made
you
the ones
having endured
the
burden
of the
day
and
the
heat.
he
but
having answered
one
of them
said,
friend,
not
I am cheating
you.
[did you] not
for a denarius
make an agreement
with me?
take
the [denarius which is]
yours
and
go.
I wish
but
to this
-
last one
to give
as
also [I give]
to you.
or
not
is it permissble
me
what
I wish
to do
with
the things [which are]
mine?
or
the

of you
envious

that
I
good

thus
will be
the
last ones
first
and
the
first ones
last.
and
going up
-
Jesus
to
Jerusalem
he took
the
twelve
disciples
privately
*
and
on
the
way
he said
to them,
behold
we are going up
to
Jerusalem,
and
the
son
-
of man
will be handed over
to the
chief priests
and
scribes,
and
they will condemn
him
to death
and
they will hand over
him
to the
gentiles
in order
*
to mock
and
to whip
and
to crucify,
and
on the
third
day
he will be raised.
then
approached
him
the
mother
of the
sons
of Zebedee
along with
the
sons
of her
worshiping
and
requesting
something
from
him.
he
and
said
to her,
what
do you wish?
she says
to him,
say
that
may sit
these
the
two
sons
of me
one
on
[the] right
of you
and
one
on
[the] left
of you
in
the
kingdom
of you.
having answered
and
-
Jesus
said,
not
you do know
what
you are asking.
are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
am about
to drink?
they say
to him,
we are able.
he says
to them,
the
indeed
cup
of me
you will drink,
-
but
to sit
on
[the] right
of me
and
on
[the] left
not
it is
mine
this
to grant
but
for whom
it has been prepared
by
the
father
of me.
and
having heard [this]
the
ten
were indignant
about
the
two
brothers.
-
but
Jesus
having summoned
them
said,
you know
that
the
rulers
of the
gentiles
lord it over
them
and
the
great ones
exercise authority over
them.
not
thus
will it be
among
you,
but
whoever
*
wishes
among
you
to become ~ great
*
will be
[the] servant
of you
and
whoever
*
wishies
among
you
to be
first
will be
[the] slave ~ of you.
*
just as
the
son
-
of man
did not come
*
to be served
but
to serve
and
to give
the
life
of him
[as] a ransom
for
many.
and
[as] [were] going out
they
from
Jericho
followed
him
a great ~ crowd.
*
and
behold
two
blind men
sitting
beside
the
road,
having heard
that
Jesus
is passing by,
cried out
saying,
have mercy on
us,
lord,
son
of David.
the
but
crowd
rebuked
them
that
they might be silent.
they
but
more
cried out
saying,
have mercy on
us,
lord,
son
of David
and
having stood
-
Jesus
called
them
and
said,
what
do you wish [that]
I should do
for you?
they say
to him,
lord,
that
may be opened
the
eyes
of us.
having been filled with compassion
and ~
-
Jesus
touched
the
eyes
of them,
and
immediately
they saw again
and
they followed
him.
and
when
they came near
to
Jerusalem
and
came
to
Bethphage,
to
the
mount
-
of Olives,
then
Jesus
sent
two
disciples
saying
to them,
go
into
the
village
-
opposite
you,
and
immediately
you will find
a donkey
having been tied
and
a colt
with
her;
having untied [them]
bring [them]
to me.
and
if
anyone
to you
should say
anything,
you say,
-
the
Lord
of them
need
has.
immediately
and
he will send
them.
this
and
took place
in order that
might be fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
the
prophet
saying,
tell
the
daughter
of Zion,
behold
the
king
of you
comes
to you
humble
and
having mounted
on
a donkey
and
upon
a colt
[the] foal
of a donkey.
having gone
and
the
disciples
and
having done
just as
commanded
them
-
Jesus
they brought
the
donkey
and
the
colt
and
they put
upon
them
the (their)
garments,
and
he sat
on
them.
the
and
very large
crowd
spread out
their
-
garments
on
the
road,
others
and
were cutting
branches
from
the
trees
and
were spreading [them] out
on
the
road.
the
and
crowds
the ones
going before
him
and
the ones
following
were crying out
saying,
hosanna
to the
son
of David;
having been blessed [is]
the one
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord;
hosanna
in
the
highest.
and
having entered
he
into
Jerusalem,
was stirred
all
the
city
saying,
who
is
this?
the
and
crowds
were saying,
this
is
the
prophet
Jesus
-
from
Nazareth
-
of Galilee.
and
entered
Jesus
into
the
temple
and
threw out
all
the ones
selling
and
buying
in
the
temple,
and
the
tables
of the
money - changers
he overturned
and
the
chairs
of the
ones selling
the
doves,
and
he says
to them,
it has been written,
the
house
of me
a house
of prayer
is to be called,
you
but
it
are making
a den
of robbers.
and
approached
him
blind persons
and
lame persons
in
the
temple,
and
he healed
them.
having seen
but
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
the
wonders
which
he performed
and
the
children
-
crying out
in
the
temple
and
saying,
hosanna
to the
son
of David,
they were indignant
and
they said
to him,
do you hear
what
these ones
are saying ?
-
and
Jesus
says
to them,
yes.
never
have you read
-
out of
[the] mouth
of children
and
nursing babies
you prepared for yourself
praise?
and
having left
them
he went
out
of the
city
to
Bethany
and
spent the night
there.
early
now
going up
into
the
city
he hungered.
and
having seen
fig tree
one
on
the
way
he went
up to
it
and
nothing
found
on
it
except
*
leaves
only,
and
he says
to it,
no longer
from
you
fruit
may there be
to
the
age.
and
was withered
at once
the
fig tree.
and
having seen [this]
the
disciples
were amazed
saying,
how [did]
instantly
wither
the
fig tree?
having answered
*and
-
Jesus
said
to them,
truly
I say
to you,
if
you have
faith
and
do not
doubt
not
only
the [thing which has been done to]
the
fig tree
will you do,
but
also if
-
to this ~ mountain
*
you say,
be lifted up
and
thrown
into
the
sea,
[and] it will happen.
and
all things
whatever
*
you may ask
in
-
prayer
believing
you will receive.
and
[after] he had gone
*
into
the
temple,
approached
him
[while he was] teaching
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
saying ,
by
what
authority
these things?
do you do
and
who
to you
gave
-
authority ?
this
having answered
and
-
Jesus
said
to them,
will ask
you
I also
one ~
question
which
if
you tell
me
I also
you
will tell
by
what
authority
I do ~ these things.
*
the
baptism
-
of John
from where
was it ?
from
heaven
or
from
men?
they
and
were discussing [it]
among
themselves
saying,
if
we say,
from
heaven,
he will say
to us,
why
*
then
not
did you believe
him?
if
but
we say,
from
men,
we fear
the
crowd,
everyone
for
as
a prophet

-
John.
and
having answered
-
Jesus
they said,
not
we do know

to them
also
he,
neither
I

another
parable
listen to.
a man
there was
a house master
who
planted
a vineyard
and
a fence
it
he put around
and
dug
in
it
a wine press
and
built
a tower
and
leased
it
to farmers
and
departed.
when
and
came near
the
time
of the
fruits,
he sent
the
slaves
of him
to
the
farmers
to receive
the
fruits
of it.
and
having taken
the
farmers
the
slaves
of him,
this one
this one
they beat,
another
*
they killed,
another
and
they stoned.
again
he sent
other
slaves
more than
the
first ones,
and
they did
to them
similarly.
finally
and
he sent
to
them
the
son
of him
saying,
they will respect
the
son
of me.
the
but
farmers
having seen
the
son
said
among
themselves,
this
is
the
heir,
come
let us kill
him
and
let us take possession of
the
inheritance
of him,
and
having taken
him
they threw him
out
of the
vineyard
and
killed [him]
when
therefore
comes
the
Lord
of the
vineyard,
what
will he do
-
farmers
to those
they say
to him,
[those] evildoers
terrible
he will bring to a end
them
and
the
vineyard
he will lease
to other
farmers,
who
will give back
to him
the
fruits
in
-
seasons
their
says
to them
-
Jesus,
have you never read
*
in
the
scriptures,
[the] stone
which
rejected
the ones
building,
this one
became
-
head
of [the] corner.
from
[the] Lord
came about
this
and
it is
marvelous
in
eyes
our
this reason
for
I say
to you
-
will be taken
from
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
it will be given
to a nation
producing
the
fruit
of it.
and
the one
having fallen
on
-
stone
this
will be crushed.
on
whomever
and
would
it falls
it will crush
him.
and
having heard
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
the
parables
of him
they understood
that
about
them
he spoke.
and
seeking
him
to arrest
they were afraid
of the
crowds,
since
as
a prophet
him
they considered
and
having answered
-
Jesus
again
spoke
in
parables
to them
saying,
is like
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
a man,
a king,
who
prepared
a wedding feast
for the
son
of him.
and
he sent out
the
slaves
of him
to call
the ones
having been invited
to
the
wedding feast,
and
not
they did want
to come.
again
he sent out
other
slaves
saying,
tell
the ones
having been invited,
behold
the
dinner
of me
I have prepared,
the
bulls
of me
and
the
fattened cattle
have been slaughtered
and
everything
is ready,
come
to
the
wedding feast.

of him.
the
and
others
having called
the
slaves
of him,
mistreated
and
killed [them]
the
so
king
was angry
and
having sent
the
armies
of him,
he destroyed
-
murderers
those
and
the
city
of them
he burned.
then
he says
to the
slaves
of him,
the
-
wedding feast
ready
is

having been invited
not

worthy.
go
therefore
to
the
crossings
of the
streets

whoever

having  gone out

those
to
the
roadways,
they gathered together
everyone
whom
they found,
bad
both
and

and
was filled
the
wedding feast
[with] guests.
having entered
and
the
king
to see
the ones
reclining at table
he saw
there
a man
not having been clothed
with

he says
to him

was speechless.

few

then
having departed
the
Pharisees
counsel together
took
so that
for him
they might set a trap
in
a statement.
and
they are sending
to him
the
disciples
of them
with
the
Herodians
saying,
teacher,
we know
that
good
you are
and
the
way
-
of God
in
truth
you teach,
and
not
it is a concern
to you
about
anybody,
not
for
you do look
into
[the] face
of men.
tell
therefore
us
what
to you
seems right,
is it permissible
to give
poll tax
to Caesar
or
not?
having known
but
-
Jesus
the
evil
of them
he said,
why
me
do you test
hypocrites?
show
me
the
coin
of the
poll tax.
they
and
brought
to him
a denarius.
and
he says
to them,
whose
-
image [is]
this
and
the
inscription?
they say
to him,
Caesar's
then
he says
to them,
give
therefore
the things
of Caesar's
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God.
and
having heard [this]
they were amazed,
and
having left
him
they went away.
on
that
-
day
approached
him
Sadducees,
saying
not
to be
a resurrection,
and
they questioned
him
saying,
teacher,
Moses
said,
if
someone
dies
not
having
children,
shall marry
the
brother
of him
the
wife
of him
and
raise up
offspring
for the
brother
of him.
there  were
now
with
us
seven
brothers.
and
the
first
having married
died,
and
not
having
offspring
left
the
wife
of him
to the
brother
of him.
likewise
also
the
second
and
the
third
up to
the
seventh.
last
and
of all
died
the
woman.
in
the
resurrection
therefore
which
of the
seven
will she be
[the] wife?
all
for
had
her.
having answered
and
-
Jesus
said
to them,
you are mistaken
not
having known
the
scriptures
nor
the
power
-
of God.
in
for
the
resurrection
neither
they marry
nor
are given in marriage,
but
like
angels
in
-
heaven
they are.
concerning
but
the
resurrection
of the
dead
not
have you read
the thing
spoken
to you
by

God
saying,
I
am
the
God
of Abraham
and
the
God
of Isaac
and
the
God
of Jacob?
not
is
-
God
of the dead ones
but
of the living ones.
and
having heard [this]
the
crowds
were being amazed
at
the
teaching
of him.
the
but
Pharisees
having heard
that
he silenced
the
Sadducees,
assembled
together,
*
*
and
questioned [him]
one
of
them,
a lawyer,
testing
him.
teacher,
which
commandment [is]
great
in

of you

of you
and
with

this
is
the

and

on
these
-
two
commandments
[the] entire
-

the

having been assembled
and
the
Pharisees,
questioned
them
-
Jesus
saying,
what
to you
seems right
concerning
the
Christ?
whose
son
is he?
they say
to him,
the [son]
of David.
he says
to them,
how
then [can]
David
in
[the] spirit
call
him
Lord
saying,
said
[the] Lord
-
Lord,
to my
sit
on
[the] right
of me,
until
*
I put
the
enemies
of you
under
the
feet
of you?
if
therefore
David
calls
him
Lord,
how
[the] son
of him
is he?
and
no one
was able
to answer
him
a word
nor
did dare
anyone
from
that
-
day
to ask
him
any more [questions].
then
-
Jesus
spoke
to the
crowds
and
to the
disciples
of him
saying,
upon
the
of Moses
seat
sat
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees.

woe
to you,

for
you cleanse

they are full
of

cleanse
first
the
inside
of the

woe
to you,

hypocrites,
for
you are like
graves
having been white washed,
which
on the outside
indeed
appear
beautiful,
~ on the inside
but
are full
of [the] bones
of dead persons
and
every kind
of impurity.
thus
also
you
on the outside
indeed
appear
-
to men
righteous,
on the inside
but
you are
full
of hypocrisy
and
lawlessness.
woe
to you,

for
you build

if
we were
in
the
days
of the
fathers
of us,
not
would
we have been

in
the
blood
of the

therefore
you testify

you
fill

how
[can] you escape

the
judgment

of gehenna (hell)?
for this reason
*
behold
I
send
to
you
prophets
and
wise men
and
scribes.
of
them
you will kill
and
you will crucify
and
of
them
you will whip
in
the
synagogues
of you
and
you will drive [them] out
from
city
to

so
came
upon
you
all
[the] righteous ~ blood
*
being shed
upon
the
earth
from
the
blood
of Abel
the
righteous
to
the
blood
of Zechariah
son
of Barachiah,
whom
you murdered
between
the
temple
and
the

truly
I say
to you,
will come
all ~ these things
*
upon
-
this ~ generation.

Jerusalem
Jerusalem,
the one
killing
the
prophets
and
stoning
the ones
having been sent
to
her,
how often
I wanted
to gather
the
children
of you,
in the 
same way
a hen
gathers
the
young ones
of her
under
the (her)
wings,
and
you were not willing.
*
behold
is left
to you
the
house
of you
desolate.
for ^ I say
*
to you,
by no means [will] you see ~ me
*
*
*
from
now
until
*
you say,
having been blessed [is]
the one
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord.
and
having gone out
-
Jesus
from
the
temple
he went,
and
approached
the
disciples
of him
to show
him
the
buildings
of the
temple.
but ~ he
*
having answered
said
to them,
not 
do you see
these things?
all ~ 
truly
I say
to you,
by no means will be left
*
*
here
a stone
upon
a stone
which
not
will be demolished.
and ~ [while] he was sitting
*
*
on
the
mount
-
of Olives
approached
him
the
disciples
privately
*
saying,
tell
us
when
these things
will be
and
what
the
sign
-
of your
coming
and
of [the] closing
of the
age?
and
having answered
-
Jesus
said
to them,
see to it [that]
someone ~ [does] not
*
deceive ^ you,
*
for ~ many
*
will come
in
the
name
of me
saying,
I
am
the
Christ,
and
they will deceive ~ many.
*
but ~ you are about
*
to hear
of wars
and
rumors
of wars.
see to it [that]
not 
you are alarmed.
* for ~ it is necessary [for this]
*
to happen,
but
not yet
it is ~
the
end.
will be raised up
for ~ 
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
and
there will be
famines
and
earthquakes
in place after place.
*
but ~ all
*
these things [are]
[the] beginning
of birth pains.
then
they will hand over
you
to
affliction
and
they will kill
you,
and
you will be hated
*
by
all
the
nations
on account of
the
name
of me.
and
then
~ will be led into sin
many
and
others
they will hand over
and
they will hate
others.
and
many
false prophets
will arise
and
they will deceive
many.
and
because of
the
increased
-
lawlessness
will become cold
the
love
-
of Many.
but ~ the one
*
having endured
to
[the] end,
this one
will be saved.
and
will be announced
this
-
good news
of the
kingdom
in
all
the
world
as
a testimony
to all
the
nations,
and
then
will come
the
end.
therefore ~ when
*
you see
the
abomination
-
of desolation
the thing
spoken
through
Daniel
the
prophet,
having stood
in
[the] place,
holy ~
the one
reading
let him understand,
then
the ones
in
-
Judea
let them flee
to
the
mountains,
the one
upon
the
roof
not
let him come down
to carry away
the things
from
the
house
of him,
and
the one
in
the
field
not
do let him turn back
behind
to carry away
the
garment
of him.
but ~ woe
*
to the ones
[who are] pregnant
*
*
and
the ones
with nursing babies
in
those
-
days.
pray
but ~ 
that
not 
may be
the
escape
of you
in winter
nor
on [the] sabbath.
will be
for ~ 
then
tribulation
great ~ 
such as
not
has been
from
[the] beginning
of [the] world
until
-
now
nor
will it by any means
*
happen again
and
if
were not cut short
*
-
those ~ days
*
not
would
be saved
all
flesh.
but ~ on account
*
of the
chosen ones
will be cut short
-
those ~ days.
*
then
if
someone
says ~ to you,
*
behold
here [is]
the
Christ,
or,
here,
not 
do believe [them].
for ~ will arise
*
false Christ
and
false prophets
and
they will give
great ~ signs
*
and
wonders
so as
to deceive,
if
possible,
even
the
chosen ones
behold
I have told beforehand
you.
if
therefore
they say
to you,
behold
in
the
desert
he is,
not 
do go out [there].
behold
in
the
inner rooms,
not 
do believe [them].
as
for ~
the
lightning
goes out
from
[the] east
and
shines
as far as
[the] west,
thus
will be
the
coming
of the
son
-
of man.
wherever
*
may be
the
corpse,
there
will be gathered together
the
vultures.
immediately
and ~ 
after
the
tribulation
-
of those ~ days
*
the
sun
will be darkened,
and
the
moon
will not give
*
the
light
of it,
and
the
stars
will fall
from
-
heaven,
and
the
powers
of the
heavens
will be shaken,
and
then
will appear
the
sign
of the
son
-
of man
in
heaven,
and
then
will mourn
all
the
tribes
of the
earth
and
they will see
the
son
-
of man
coming
on
the
clouds
-
of heaven
with
power
and
great ~ glory.
*
and
he will send
the
angels
of him
with
a loud ~ trumpet call,
*
and
they will gather together
the
chosen ones
of him
from
the
four
winds
from
[one] end
of [the] heavens
to
the
[other] end
of it.
and ~ from
*
the
fig tree
learn
the
parable.
when
already
the
branch
of it
has become
tender
and
-
it sprouts ~ leaves,
*
you know
that
[is] near
-
summer.
thus
also
you,
when
you see
all
these things
you know
that
near
it is ~
at
[the] doors.
truly
I say
to you
-
by no means 
*
will pass away
-
this ~ generation
*
until
*
all
these things
come about.
-
heaven
and
-
earth
will pass away,
but ~ the
*
words
of me
by no means
*
will pass away
but ~ concerning
*
-
that ~ day
*
and
hour
no one
knows,
nether
the
angels
of the
heavens
nor
the
son,
except
*
the
father
alone.
for ~ as
*
in the
days
-
of Noah,
thus
will be
the
coming
of the
son
-
of man.
for ~ as
*
they were
in
-
those ~ days
*
-
before
the
flood
eating
and
drinking,
and ~ marrying
and
being given in marriage,
until [the] day [when]
*
*
entered
Noah
into
the
ark,
and
they did not know
*
until
came
the
flood
and
took away
everything,
thus
will be
also
the
coming
of the
son
-
of man.
then
two men
will be
in
the
field,
one
is taken
and
one
is left.
two women
are grinding
in
the
mill house,
one
is taken
and
one
is left.
so ~ be on guard,
*
because
you do not know
*
on which
day
the
Lord
of you
comes.
that
and ~
you know
that
if
had known
the
house master
in which
watch
the
thief
is coming,
he stayed awake
would have 
and
not 
would have 
allowed
to be dug through
the
house
of him.
for this reason
*
also
you
be
ready,
for
when
you do not think
*
in [the] hour
the
son
-
of man
comes.
who
then
is
the
faithful
slave
and
wise
whom
appointed
the
master
over
the
slave of the household
of him
-
to give
to them
-
food
at
[the] proper time?
blessed [is]
-
that ~ slave
*
whom
[when] having come
the
master
of him
finds
so
doing.
truly
I say
to you
that
over
all
the
possessions
of him
he will appoint
him.
but ~ if
*
says
-
wicked
slave
that
in
the
heart
of him,
is lingering
my
-
master,
and
he begins
to beat
the
fellow slaves
of him,
and ~ he eats
*
and
drinks
with
the ones
being drunk,
will come
the
master
-
of that ~ slave
*
on
a day
which
he does not expect
*
and
at
an hour
which
he does not know,
*
and
he will cut in two
him
and
the
portion
of him
with
the
hypocrites
he will put.
there
will be
-
weeping
and
-
grinding
of the
teeth.
then
will be compared
the
kingdom
of the
heavens
to ten
virgins,
who
having taken
the
lamps
of them
went out
to
meet
the
bridegroom.
five
now ~
of
them
were
foolish
and
five [were]
wise.
the
for ~ 
foolish
having taken
-
lamps
of them
not 
did take
with
them
oil.
but ~ the
*
wise ones
took
oil
in
-
containers
with
the
lamps
of them.
now ~ being delayed
*
the
bridegroom,
*  became drowsy
* all [of the virgins] ~
and
were sleeping.
and ~ at midnight
*
*
there was ~ a shout,
*
behold
the
bridegroom,
go out
to
meet
him.
then
awakened
all
-
virgins
those ~ 
and
they trimmed
the
lamps
of them.
but ~ the
*
foolish
to the
wise
said,
give
us
from
the
oil
of you,
for
the
lamps
of us
are going out.
but ~ answered
*
the
wise ones
saying,
certainly
not 
*
there would be enough
for us
and
for you.
go
instead ~
to
the ones
selling
and
buy
for yourselves.
and ~ [as] they were going away
*
*
to buy,
came
the
bridegroom
and
the ones
prepared
entered
with
him
into
the
wedding celebration
and
was shut
the
door.
and ~ later
*
come
also
the
other
virgins
saying,
Lord,
Lord,
open [the door]
for us.
but ~ he
*
having answered
said,
truly
I say
to you,
I do not know
*
you.
be one the alert
therefore,
for
you do not know
*
the
day
nor
the
hour.
as
for ~
a man
going on a journey
called
to this
own
slaves
and
handed over
to them
the
possessions
of him.
and
to this one
*
he gave
five
talents,
to this one
and ~
two,
to this one,
and ~ 
one,
each
according to
-
his own
ability,
and
went on [his] journey.
immediately
having gone
the one
the
five
talents
having received
worked
with
them
and
gained
five ~ others.
*
likewise
the one [having received]
the
two
gained
two ~ others.
*
but ~ the one
*
the
one [talent]
having received,
having gone out
dug
in [the] ground
and
hid
the
money
of the
master
of him.
and ~ after
*
much
time
comes
the
master
-
of those ~ slaves
*
and
settles accounts
*
with
them.
and
having approached
the one
the
five
talents
having received
brought
five ~ more
*
talents
saying,
master,
five
talents
you gave ~ to me.
*
see,
five ~ more
*
talents
I gained.
said
to him
the
master
of him,
well done,
slave
good
and
faithful,
over
a few things
you were
faithful,
over
many things
I will appoint ~ you.
*
enter
into
the
joy
of the
master
of you.
and ~ having  approached
*
also
the one
the
two
talents [having received]
said,
master,
two
talents
you gave ~ to me.
*
see,
more
two ~
talents
I gained.
said
to him
the
master
of him,
well done,
slave
good
and
faithful,
over
a few things
you were
faithful,
over
many things
I will appoint ~ you.
*
enter
into
the
joy
of the
master
of you.
and ~ having approached
*
also
the ones
the
one
talent
having received
said,
master,
I knew
you
that ~ 
a hard
are ~ 
man,
reaping
where
not
you did sow
and
gathering
from which
you did not scatter,
*
and
having been afraid [and]
having gone away
I hid
the
talent
of you
in
the
ground.
see,
you have
that which [is]
yours.
and ~ having answered,
*
the
master
of him
said
to him,
wicked
slave
and
lazy,
[so] you knew
that
I reap
where
I did not sow
*
and
I gather
from which
I did not scatter?
*
it was necessary
for you
then
to deposit
the
money
of me
with the
with the
and
having come
I
would have received back
*
that which [was]
mine
with
interest.
take
therefore
from
him
the
talent
and
give [it]
to the one
having
the
ten
talents.
for ~ to
*
everyone ~ having
*
it will be given
and
he will have an abundance,
but ~ from the one
*
not having
*
even
what
he has
will be taken
from
him.
and
the
useless
slave
throw
into
the
darkness
-
outer
there
will be
-
weeping
and
-
grinding
of the
teeth.
and ~ when
*
comes
the
son
-
of man
in
the
glory
of him
and
all
the
angels
with
him,
then
he will sit
upon
[the] throne
of glory
of him.
and
will be assembled
before
him
all
the
nations,
and
he will separate
them
from
each other,
as
the
shepherd
separates
the
sheep
from
the
goats,
and
he will put
the
-
sheep
on
[the] right
of him,
but ~ the
*
goats
on
[the] left.
then
will say
the
king
to the ones
on
[the] right
of him,
come
the ones
having been blessed
of the
father
of me,
inherit
the
having been prepared
for you
kingdom
from
[the] foundation
of [the] world.
for ~ I hungered
*
and
you gave
to me
to eat,
I thirsted
and
you gave drink
to me,
I was ~ a stranger
*
and
you invited in
me,
naked
and
you clothed
me,
I was sick
and
you visited
me,
in
prison
I was
and
you came
to
me.
then
answered
him
the
righteous ones
saying,
master,
when
you
did we see ~ 
hungering
and
we fed [you]
or
thirsting
and
we gave [you] drink?
when
and ~ 
you
did we see ~ 
a stranger
and
invite [you] in,
or
naked
and
we clothed [you]?
when
and ~ 
you
did we see ~ 
having sickness
or
in
prison
and
we came
to
you?
and
having answered
the
king
will say
to them,
truly
I say
to you,
in 
as much as
you did [it]
to one
of these
of the
brothers
of me
the
least,
~ to me.
you did [it] ~
then
he will say
also
to the ones
on
[the] left [of him],
go
from
me
the ones
having been cursed
into
the
fire
-
eternal
-
having been prepared
for the
devil
and
the
angels
of him.
I hungered
for ~ 
and
not 
you did give
to me
to eat,
I thirsted
and
not 
you did give drink
to me.
a stranger
I was ~ 
and
not 
you did invite in
me,
naked
and
not 
you did clothe
me,
sick
and
in
prison
and
not 
you did visit
me.
then
will answer
also
they
saying,
Lore,
when
you
did we see ~ 
hungering
or
thirsting
or
a stranger
or
naked
or
sick
or
in
prison
and
we did not help
*
you?
then
he will answer
them
saying,
truly
I say
to you,
in
as much as
not
you did do [it]
for one
of these
the
least ones,
neither
for me
did you do [it].
and
will go away
these
into
eternal ~ punishment,
*
the
but ~
righteous ones
into
life.
eternal ~
and
it came about
when
finished
-
Jesus
all
-
these ~ words,
*
he said
to the
disciples
of him,
you know
that
after
two
days
the
passover
takes place,
and
the
son
-
of man
is handed over
* to
*
* be crucified.
then
were assembled
the
;
and
the
elders
of the
people
in
the
palace
of the
high priest,
the one
being called
Caiaphas.
and
they took counsel together
that
-
Jesus
by a trap
they might arrest
and
might kill.
but ~ they were saying,
*
not
during
the
feast,
lest
*
a disturbance
occurs
among
the
people.
-
and
Jesus
being
in
Bethany
in
[the] house
of Simon
the
Leper,
approached
him
a woman
having
an alabaster [flask]
of expensive ~ ointment
*
and
she poured [it] out
upon
the
head
of him
reclining at the table.
and ~ having seen [this]
*
the
disciples
were angry
saying,
for
what
-
this ~ waste?
*
* it would have been possible
* for ~
* this
* to sell ~
for much
and
to give [it]
to [the] poor.
* having known [this]
* and ~
-
Jesus
said
to them,
why
* trouble
* are you causing ~
for the
woman?
work
for
a good
she does
to
me.
for ~ always
*
the
poor
you have
with
yourselves,
but ~ me
*
not
always
do you have.
having put
for
this woman
-
this ~ ointment
*
upon
the
body
of me
* in order to
*
* prepare for burial
me
she did [it].
truly,
I say
to you,
wherever
*
is preached
-
this ~ good news
*
in
[the] whole
-
world,
it will be spoken
also
what
this woman~ did
*
in
memory
of her.
then
having gone
one
of the
twelve,
the one
being called
Judas
Iscariot,
to
the
chief priests
said,
what
are you willing
to give ~ me,
*
and I
to you
will hand over
him?
and ~ they
*
weighed out
for him
thirty
pieces of silver.
and
from
then [on]
he was seeking
an opportunity
that
him.
he might hand over ~ 
on the
but ~
first [day]
of the
[feast] of unleavened bread
approached
the
disciples
-
to Jesus
saying,
where
do you wish
we should prepare
for you
to eat
the
passover?
and ~ he
*
said,
go
into
the
city
to
such a one
*
and
say
to him,
the
teacher
says,
the
time
of me
is ~ near,
*
with
you
I am making
the
passover
with
the
disciples
of me.
and
did
the
disciples
as
commanded
them
-
Jesus
and
they prepared
the
passover meal.
and ~ [when] evening came
*
*
he was reclining at table
with
the
twelve.
and
[as] they ~ were eating
*
he said,
truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
me.
and
grieving
greatly
they began
to say
to him
each ~ one,
*
surely not
I
am [the one],
Lord?
but ~ he
*
having answered
said,
the one
having dipped
with
me
the
hand
in
the
bowl
this one
will betray ~ me.
*
indeed ~ the
*
son
-
of man
is going
just as
it has been written
concerning
him,
but ~ woe
*
-
to that ~ man.
*
through
whom
the
son
-
of man
is betrayed.
~ better
it would have been
for him
if
not
had been born
-
that ~ man.
*
and ~ having answered
*
Judas
the one
betraying
him
said,
surely not
I
am [the one],
rabbi?
he says
to him,
you
have said [it].
and ~ [as] they were eating,
*
*
having taken
-
Jesus
bread
and
having given thanks
he broke [it]
and
giving [it]
to the
disciples [and]
said,
take [and]
eat,
this
is
the
body
of me.
and
having taken
[the] cup
and
having given thanks
he gave
to them
saying,
drink
from
it
all [of you].
this
for ~
is
the
blood
of me
of the
covenant
that which
for
many
is being shed
for
forgiveness
of sins.
and ~ I say
*
to you,
I will by no means drink
*
*
from
now [on]
of
this
-
fruit
of the
vine
until
-
that ~ day
*
when
I drink ~ it
*
with
you
new
in
the
kingdom
of the
father
of me.
and
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
mount
-
of olives.
then
says
to them
-
Jesus,
all
of you
will be offended
at
me
during
-
~ night,
this
for ~ it has been written,
*
I will strike down
the
shepherd.
and
will be scattered
the
sheep
of the
flock.
after
but ~ 
but ~ 
am raised
I 
I will go ahead of
you
to
-
Galilee.
and ~ having answered
*
-
Peter
said
to him,
if
everyone
will be offended
at
you,
I
never
will be offended.
said
to him
-
Jesus,
truly
I say
to you
that
during
this
-
night
before
a cock
crows
three times
you will deny
me.
says
to him
-
Peter,
even if
it is necessary
for me
with
you
to die,
by no means
*
will I deny ~ you.
*
likewise
also
all
the
disciples
spoke.
then
comes
with
them
-
Jesus
to
a place
being called
Gethsemane
and
he says
to the
disciples,
sit
here
until
*
having left
there
I may pray.
and
having taken
-
Peter
and
the
two
sons
of Zebedee
he began
to be grieved
and
to be distressed.
then
he says
to them,
very sad
is
the
soul
of me
to the point of
death.
remain
here
and
keep awake
with
me.
and
having gone forward
a little
he fell
upon
face
his 
praying
and
saying,
father
of me,
if
possible,
it is ~ 
let pass
from
me
-
cup.
this ~
but
not
as
I
wish
but
as
you [wish].
and
he comes
to
the
disciples
and
he finds
them
sleeping,
and
he says
-
to Peter,
so
were you not strong enough
*
[for] one
hour
to be awake
with
me?
stay awake
and
pray,
lest
*
you enter
into
temptation.
the
indeed ~
spirit [is]
ready
the
but ~ 
flesh [is]
weak.
again
for
a second [time]
having left
he prayed
saying,
father
of me,
if
not
it is possible [for]
this
to pass away
except
*
it,
I drink ~ 
let be done
the
will
of you.
and
having come
again
he found
them
sleeping,
for ~ were
*
of them
the
eyes
having been weighed down.
and
having left
them
again [and]
having gone away
he was praying
for
[the] third [time]
the
same
thing
having said
again.
then
he comes
to
the
disciples
and
he says
to them,
sleep
-
from now on
and
rest.
behold
has drawn near
the
hour
and
the
son
-
of man
is being betrayed
into
[the] hands
of sinners.
rise up [and]
let us go.
behold
has drawn near
the one
betraying
me.
and
yet
[while] he
[was] speaking,
behold
Judas
one
of the
twelve
came
and
with
him
a great ~ crowd
*
with
swords
and
clubs
from
the
chief priests
and
elders
of the
people.
and ~ the one
*
betraying
him
gave
them
a sign
saying,
whomever
*
I may kiss
he
is [the one],
arrest
him.
and
immediately
having approached
-
Jesus
he said,
hello,
rabbi,
and
he kissed
him.
-
and
Jesus
said
to him,
friend, [do that]
for
which
you are coming
then
having approached
they laid
the (their)
hands
on
-
Jesus
and
they arrested
him.
and
behold
one
of the ones
with
Jesus
having stretched out
the (his)
hand
drew
the
sword
of him
and
having struck
the
servant
of the
high priest
he cut off
of him
the
ear.
then
says
to him
-
Jesus,
return
the
sword
of you
into
the
place
of it,
for ~ all
*
the ones
having taken
[the] sword
by
[the] sword
will die.
or
do you think
that
I am not able
*
to call upon
the
father
of me,
and
he will provide
me
now
more than
twelve
legions
of angels?
how
then
may be fulfilled
the
scriptures
that [say]
thus
it is necessary
to happen?
at
that
-
time
said
-
Jesus
to the
crowds,
as
against
a rober
have you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
to arrest
me?
daily
*
in
the
temple
I was sitting
teaching
and
you did not arrest
*
me.
but ~ this
*
all
happened
that
might be fulfilled
the
scriptures
of the
prophets.
then
the
disciples
all
having
him
fled.
but ~ the ones
*
having arrested
-
Jesus
led [him] away
to
Caiaphas
the
high priest,
where
the
scribes
and
the
elders
were gathered together.
-
and
Peter
was following
him
from
far away
as far as
the
courtyard
of the
high priest
and
having entered
inside
he was sitting down
with
the
servants
to see
the
outcome.
and ~ the
*
chief priests
and
the
sanhedrin
all
were seeking
false witness
against
-
Jesus
so that
him
they might put to death,
and
they did not find
*
many
* having approached.
* false witnesses ~
* later
* but ~
having approached
two
said,
this one
said,
I am able
to destroy
the
temple
-
of God
and
within
three
days
to build [it].
and
having arisen
the
high priest
said
to him,
do you answer ~ nothing
*
what
these men
testify against ~ you?
*
-
but
Jesus
was silent.
and
the
high priest
said
to him,
I adjure
you
by
-
God
the one
living
that
to us
you tell
if
you
are
the
Christ,
the
son
-
of God.
says
to him
-
Jesus,
you
said [it].
but
I say
to you,
from
now on
you will see
the
son
-
of man
sitting
at
[the] right [hand]
of the
power
and
coming
upon
the
clouds
-
of heaven.
then
the
high priest
tore
the
garments
of him
saying,
he has blasphemed.
what
further
need
do we have
of witnesses?
see,
now
you have heard
the
blasphemy.
what
does [it] seem ~ to you?
*
and ~ they
*
having answered
said,
deserving
of death
he is.
then
they spat
into
the
face
of him
and
they struck
him,
and ~ they
*
slapped [him]
saying,
prophesy
to us,
Christ,
who
is
the one
having hit
you?
-
now
Peter
was sitting
outside
in
the
courtyard.
and
approached
him
one
maid
saying,
and
you
were
with
Jesus
-
of Galilee.
but ~ he
*
denied [it]
before
everyone
saying,
I do not know
*
what
you are saying.
and ~ having gone out
*
to
the
gate
saw
him
another
and
she says
to the ones
there,
this one
was
with
Jesus
-
of Nazareth.
and
again
he denied [it]
with
an oath
-
I do not know
*
the
man.
after
a little [while]
and
having approached
the ones
having stood
said
-
to Peter,
truly
also
you
of
them
are,
even
for ~
the ones
accent
of you
manifest
you
makes.
then
he began
to curse
and
to swear [saying]
-
I do not know
*
the
man.
and
immediately
a cock
crowed.
and
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
of Jesus
having spoken
-
before
a cock
crows
three times
you will deny
me.
and
having gone
outside
he wept
bitterly.
* [when] early morning
* and ~
* came
* counsel together
* took ~
all
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
of the
people
against
-
Jesus
so as
to put to death
him.
and
having bound
him
they led [him] away
and
handed [him] over
to Pilate
the
governor.
then
having seen
Judas,
the one
betraying
him,
that
he was condemned [to die],
having repented
he returned
the
thirty
pieces of silver
to the
chief priests
and
[the] elders
saying,
I sinned
having betrayed
innocent ~ blood.
*
but ^ they
*
said,
what [is that]
to
us?
you
see[ to it].
and
having thrown
the
silver [coins]
into
the
temple
he departed,
and
having gone away
he hanged himself.
but ~ the
*
chief priests
having taken
the
silver [coins]
said,
it is not permissible
*
to put
these
into
the
temple treasury,
since
[the] price
of blood
it is.
* counsel together
* so ~
* having taken
they bought
with
them
the
field
of the
potter
for
a burial place
-
for strangers.
therefore
was called
-
that ~ field
*
[the] field
of blood
up to
-
today.
then
was fulfilled
the [thing]
spoken
through
Jeremiah
the
prophet
saying,
and
they took
the
thirty
pieces of silver,
the
price
of the one
having been valued
which
they estimated
from
[the] sons
of Israel.
and
they gave
them
for
the
field
of the
potter,
just as
commanded
me
[the] Lord.
-
now
Jesus
stood
before
the
governor.
and
asked
him
the
governor
saying,
are you
*
the
king
of the
Jews?
-
and
Jesus
said,
you
are saying [it],
and
* when ~
*
* ~ was accused
* ~ he ~
by
the
chief priests
and
elders
he answered ~ nothing.
*
then
says
to him
-
Pilate,
do you not hear
*
how many things
they testify against ~ you?
*
and
he did not answer
*
him
with
even
one
word,
so as
to amaze
the
governor
greatly.
according to
and ~ 
[the] festival
was accustomed
the
governor
to release
one
to the
crowd
prisoner
whom [ever]
they wished.
~ they had
and 
then
a notorious ~ prisoner
*
being called
Jesus
Barabbas.
therefore
[as] were gathering
they,
said
to them
-
Pilate,
whom
do you wish [that]
I may release
to you,
Jesus
-
Barabbas
or
Jesus
the one
being called
Christ?
for ~ he had known
*
that
on account
of envy
they handed over
him.
[while] was sitting
and ~ 
he 
on
the
judgment seat
sent
to
him
the
wife
of him
saying,
[let there be] nothing [between]
you
and
-
righteous [man],
that ~
for ~ much
*
I suffered
today
in a dream
*
on account of
him.
but ~ the
*
chief priests
and
the
elders
persuaded
the
crowds
that
they should ask for
-
Barabbas,
-
but
Jesus
they should destroy.
and ~ having answered,
*
the
governor
said
to them,
whom
do you wish
from
the
two [that]
I may release
to you?
and ~ they
*
said,
-
Barabbas.
says
to them
-
Pilate,
what
therefore
may I do
[with] Jesus
the one
being called
Christ?
says
everyone,
let [him] be crucified.
but ~ he
*
said,
why
what
evil thing
has he done?
but ~ they
*
were crying out ~ more
*
saying,
let [him] be crucified.
and ~ having seen
*
-
Pilate
that
nothing
he is accomplishing
but
rather
an uproar
is starting.
having taken
water
he washed
the (his)
hands
before
the
crowd
saying,
I am ~ innocent
*
of
the
blood
of this [man].
you
will see [to that].
and
having answered
all
the
people
said,
the
blood
of him [be]
upon
us
and
upon
the
children
of us.
then
he released
to them
-
Barabbas,
-
but
Jesus
having scourged
he handed over
that
he might be crucified.
then
the
soldiers
of the
governor
having taken
-
Jesus
into
the
praetorium
gathered together
against
him
[the] entire
-
cohort.
and
having stripped
him
a scarlet ~ robe
*
they placed around
him.
and
having woven
a crown
of
thorns
they placed [it]
upon
the
head
of him
and [put]
a staff
in
the
right [hand]
of him.
and
having knelt
before
him
they ridiculed
him
saying,
hail,
king
of the
Jews.
and
having spat
at
him
they took
the
staff
and
were striking
at
the
head
of him.
and
when
they ridiculed
him,
they took off
his
-
scarlet [robe]
and
dressed
him,
in the
garments
of him
and
led away
him
* to
*
* be crucified.
and ~ coming out
*
they found
a man
a Cyrenian
by [the] name
of Simon,
this [man]
they pressed into service
that
he might carry
the
cross
of him.
and
having come
to
[the] place
being called
Golgotha,
which
is
of [the] skull
[the] place
being called,
they  gave
to him
to drink
wine
with
gall
having been mixed [in].
and
tasting [it]
he did not wish
*
to drink.
having crucified
and ~ 
him
they divided
the
garments
of him
casting
a lot,
and
sitting
they guarded
him
there.
and
they placed
above
the
head
of him
the
charge
of him
having been written:
this
is
Jesus
the
king
of the
Jews.
then
were crucified
with
him
two
thieves,
one
on
[the] right
and
one
on
[the] left.
and ~ the ones
*
passing by
blasphemed
him
shaking
the
heads
of them
and
saying,
the one
destroying
the
temple
and
in
three
days [and]
building [it],
save
yourself,
if
you are~ [the] son
*
-
of God,
and
come down
from
the
cross.
likewise
also
the
chief priests
mocking
with
the
scribes
and
elders
said,
he saved ~ others,
*
[yet] himself
he is not able
*
to save.
[some] king
of Israel
he is,
let [him] come down
now
from
the
cross
and
we will believe
on
him.
he has trusted
in
-
God,
let him rescue
now
if
he wants
him.
for ~ he said
*
-
of God
I am
[the] son.
and ~ the
*
same
also [spoke]
the
thieves,
the ones
having been crucified
with
him
they were reproaching
him.
from
now ~
[the] sixth
hour
darkness
was
over
all
the
land
until
[the] ninth ~ hour.
*
and ~ about
*
the
ninth
hour
cried out
-
Jesus
with a loud ~ voice
*
saying,
Eli,
Eli
lema
sabachthani?
this
means,
my  God,
*
my  God,
*
why
have you forsaken ~ me?
*
and ~ some
*
of the ones
having stood ~ there [and]
*
having listened
said
-
Elijah
calls for

to untie
the
strap
of the
sandals
of him.
I

days [that]
came
Jesus
from
Nazareth
-
of Galilee
and
was baptized
in
the
Jordan [river]
by
John.
and
immediately
coming up
out
of the
water
he saw
being opened
the
heavens
and
the
spirit
as
a dove
descending
towards
him.
and
a voice
there was
out of
the
heavens,
you
are
the
son
of me
the
beloved
with
you
I am well pleased.
and
immediately
the
spirit

drives out
into

and
passing by
a alongside

of Galilee
he saw
Simon
and
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon,
casting [their nets]
into
the
lake
they were
for
fishermen.
and
said
to them
-
Jesus
come
after
me,
and
I will make
you
to become
fishermen
of men.
and
immediately
leaving
the (their)
nets
they followed
him.
and
having gone on
a little,
he saw
James
the [son]
-
of Zebedee
and
John
the
brother
of him
and
they [were]
in

and
they enter

and
immediately
on the
Sabbaths
entering
into
the
synagogue
he was teaching [them].
and
they were amazed
at
-
teaching

he was
for
teaching
them
as
authority
(one) having
and
not
as
the
scribes.
and
immediately
there was
in

synagogue
their
a man
with
spirit
an unclean
and
he cried out
saying,
what
to us
and
to you,
Jesus
[the] Nazarene?
have you come
to destroy
us?
I know
you,
who
you are,
the
holy one
-
of God.
and
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
saying,
be quiet
and
come out
of
him.
and
having convulsed
him,
the
spirit
-
unclean
and
having cried out
voice
with a loud
it came out
of
him.
and
was   amazed
everyone
so as
[to begin] to discuss
with
each other
saying,
what
is
this?
ateaching
*a new
with
authority
-
the
spirits
-
unclean
he commands
and
they obey
him.
and
went out
the
report
of him
immediately
everywhere
into
all
the
surrounding countryside
-
of Galilee.
and
immediately
out
of the
synagogue
coming
they went
into
the
house
of Simon
and
Andrew
with
James
and
John.
the
and
mother -in-law
of Simon
was lying down
having a fever,
and
right away
they speak
to him
concerning
her.
and
having approached,
he raised
her
taking [her]
by the
hand;
and
left
her
the
fever,
and
she was serving
them.
evening
and
having come,
when
set
the
sun,
they were bringing
to
him
all
the ones
illness
*having
and
the ones
being demon - possessed.
and
was
whole
the
city
gathered together
at
the
door.
and
he healed
many
~ illness
having ~
with various
diseases
and
demons
many
he cast out
and
he did not
*permit
to speak
the
demons,
because
they had known
him.
and
early
at night
very
having arisen,
he went out
and
went away
to
a desolate
place
and there
he was praying.
and
searched
[for] him
Simon
and
the ones
with
him.
and
they found
him
and
they say
to him
-
everyone
is (are) looking for
you.
and
he says
to them,
let us go
elsewhere
into
the
neighboring
villages,
so that
also
there
I may preach
for
this [purpose]
for
I came.
and
he came
preaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
in
[the] whole [region of]
-
Galilee
and
the
demons
casting out.
and
comes
to
him
a leper
begging
him
and
kneeling down
and
saying
to him
-
if
you are willing
you are able
me
to cleanse
and
being filled with compassion
[and] stretching out
the
hand
of him
he touched [the man]
and
says
to him,
I am willing,
be cleansed.
and
immediately
went away
from
him
the
leprosy,
and
he was cleansed.
and
having sternly warned
him,
immediately
he sent out
him
and
he says
to him,
see [that]
to no one
nothing
you say
but rather
go
yourself
show
to the
priest
and
offer [the sacrifices]
for
the
cleansing
of you
which
commanded
Moses
for
a testimony
to them.
the one
but
having gone out
began
to preach
many things
and
to spread
the
word,
so that
no longer
he
was able
openly
into [the]
city
to enter,
but
outside
into [the]
desolate
places
he was.
and
they were coming
to
him
from every direction.
and
having entered
again
into
Capernaum
after [many]
days,
it was heard
that
at
home
he is.
and
were gathered together
many ~
so as
no longer
to have room
-
-
at
the
door,
and
he was speaking
to them
the
word.
and
they come
carrying
to
him
a paralytic
being carried along
by 
four [men].
and
not
being able
to bring [the paralytic]
to him
on account of
the
crowd,
they removed
the
roof
where
he was
and
having made an opening
they lowered
the
mattress
upon which
the
paralytic
was lying.
and
having seen
-
Jesus
the
faith
of them
says
to the
paralytic,
child,
are forgiven
your
-
sins.
and ~ there were
*
some
of the
scribes
there
sitting
and
thinking about [these things]
in
the
hearts
of them,
why [is]
this one
thus?
speaking
he blasphemes,
who
is able
to forgive
sins
* except
*
[the] one,
-
God?
and
immediately
having known
-
Jesus
in the
spirit
of him
that
in this manner
they are dialoguing
among
themselves
he says
to them,
why
these things
are you considering
in
the
hearts
of you?
which
is
easier,
to say
to the
paralytic,
are forgiven
your
-
sins,
or
to say,
stand
and
pick up
the
mattress
of you
and
walk?
in order that
but ~
you may know
that
authority
has ~
the
son
-
of man
to forgive
sins
upon
-
* earth -
he says
to the
paralytic,
to you
I say,
stand,
pick up
the
mattress
of you
and
go
to
the
home
of you.
and
he arose
and
immediately
taking
the
mattress
went outside
in front of
everyone,
so as
to astonish
everyone,
and
to glorify
-
god
saying,
-
thus
never
have we seen.
and
he went out
again
beside
the
lake
and
all
the
crowd
was coming
to
him,
and
he was teaching
them
and
passing by
he saw
Levi
the [son]
-
of Alphaeus
sitting
in
the
tax office,
and
he says
to him,
follow
me,
and
rising up
he followed
him.
and
it came to pass
[that] reclined
he
in
the
house
of him,
and
many
tax collectors
and
sinners
were reclining
-
with Jesus
and
with the
disciples
of him
there were
for ~
many
and
they were following
him.
and
the
scribes
of the
Pharisees
seeing
that
he eats
with
-
sinners
and
tax collectors
were saying
to the
disciples
of him
-
with
-
tax collectors
and
sinners
does he eat?
and
having heard [this]
-
Jesus
says
to them
-
no
need
have
the
strong ones
of a physician
but rather
the ones
~ illness.
having ~
I did not come
*
to call
[the] righteous
but rather
sinners.
and
came
the
disciples
of John
and
the
Pharisees
fasting.
and
they come
and
say
to him,
why [do]
*
the
disciples
of John
and
the
disciples
of the
Pharisees
fast,
-
but
your
disciples
do not fast?
*
and
said
to them
-
Jesus,
are not able
*
[surely] the
attendants
of the
bride chamber
while
*
the
groom
with
them
is
to fast ?
as long as
*
they have
the
groom
with
them
not
they are ~able
to fast.
~ will come
but ~
days
when
is taken away
from
them
the
groom,
and
then
they will fast
in
that
-
day.
no one

and
it came about [that]
he
on
the
sabbath (s)
was passing
through
the
grainfields,
and
the
disciples
of him
began
[their] way
to make ~
picking
the
heads of grain.
and
the
Pharisees
said
to him,
look,
why
are they doing
on the
Sabbaths
what
not
is ~ permitted?
and
he says
to them,
never~
have you read
what
did
David
when
need
he had ~ 
and
he was hungry,
he
and
the ones
with
him,
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
during [the days of]
Abiathar
[the] high priest
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
he ate
which
~ not ~
is ~ permitted
to be eaten
except
*
by the
priests,
and
he gave [some]
also
to the ones
with
him
being?
and
he said
to them,
the
Sabbath
on account of
-
man
was created
and
not
-
man
on account of
of the
Sabbath.
so that
lord
is
the
son
-
of man
even
of the
Sabbath.
and
he entered
again
into
the
synagogue.
and
was
there
a man
shriveled
having
-
hand.
and
they were watching
him
[to see] if
on the
sabbaths
he will heal
him,
in order that
they might accuse
him.
and
he says
to the
man,
the one
with the
withered
hand
having,
stand up
in
the one
middle.
and
he says
to them,
is it permitted
on the
sabbaths
good
to do
or
to do evil,
life
to restore
or
to destroy [it]?
they
but
were silent.
and
having looked
[at] them
with
anger,
being deeply grieved
at
the
hardness
-
heart
of their
he says
to the
man,
stretch out
the (your)
hand,
and
he stretched [it] out
and
was restored

hand
of him.
and
going out
the
Pharisees
immediately
with
the
Herodians
consultation
held
against
him
as to how
him.
they might destroy
and
-
Jesus
with
the
disciples
of him
went away
to
the
lake,
and
a great
multitude
from

and
the
spirits

unclean,
whenever
him
they saw
were falling before
him
and
were crying out
saying
-

he goes up
toward

mountain
and
summons

and
they came
to

they might be
with
him

that
he might send
them

the
ruler
of the
demons

-
demons.
and
having called
them,
in
parables
he was speaking
to them,
how
is it possible [for]
Satan
Satan
to cast out?
and
if
a kingdom
against
itself

it is not
possible (for)
to stand
-
kingdom
that.
and
if
a house
against
itself
is divided,
it will not be
possible (for)
-
house
that
to stand.
and
if
-
Satan
stood up
against
himself
and
was divided,
it is not
possible (for)
to stand
but
an end
he has
but
but
is able
no one
into
the
house
of the
strong man
having entered
the
possessions
of him
to plunder.
unless
*
first,
the
strong man
he binds,
and
then
the
house
of him
he will plunder.
truly
I say
to you
that
everything
will be forgiven
the
sons
-
of men
the
sins
and
the
blasphemies
* whatever
*
they may blaspheme.
whoever
but
but
blasphemes
against
the
spirit
-
holy,
does not
have
forgiveness
into
the
age,
but
guilty
is
of an eternal
sin.
for
they were saying,
spirit
an unclean
he was.
and
comes
the
mother
of him
and
the
brothers
of him
and
outside
standing
they sent
to
him
calling
him.
and
were sitting
around
him
a crowd,
and
they are saying
to him,
behold
the
mother
of you
and
the
brothers
of you
and
the
sisters
of you [are]
outside
looking for
you.
and
having answered
them
he says,
who
is
the
mother
of me
and
the
brothers
of me?
and
having looked around at
the ones
around
him
in a circle
sitting
he says,
behold
the ones
mother
of me
and
the ones
brothers
of me.
whoever
for
*
does
the
will
-
of God
this one
[the] brother
of me
and
sister
and
mother
is .
and
again
he began
to teach
beside
the
lake
and
gathered together
to
him
a  crowd
huge
so that
he
into
a boat
having gotten in
to sit
into
the
lake,
and
all
the
crowd
near
the
lake
on
the
land
were.
and
he was teaching
them
with
* ~ parables
* many
and
he was saying
to them
in
the
teaching
of him.
listen,
behold
went out
the one
sowing
to sow [seed].
and
it came about
while
-
[he went] to sow [that]
[seed]
some
fell
beside
the
road,
and
came
the
birds
and
devoured
it.
and
other [seed]
fell
upon
the
rocky place
where
* not
* it did ~ have
* ~ soil,
* much
and
immediately
it sprang up
because
-
* not
* it did ~ have
depth
of soil.
and
when
rose
the
sun
it was scorched
and
because
-
* not
* it did ~ have
a root
it withered.
and
other [seed]
fell
into
the
thorn bushes,
and
came up
the
thorns
and
choked
it,
and
fruit
not
it did give.
and
others
fell
into
the
soil
-
good
and
it was giving
fruit
rising up
and
growing
and
it was bearing [fruit]
one
thirty
and
one
sixty
and
one
one hundred.
and
he was saying,
who
has
ears
to hear
let him hear.
and
when
he was
* by
* himself,
were asking
him
the ones
around
him
with
the ones
twelve
the [meaning of the]
parables.
and
he was saying
to them,
to you
the
mystery
has been given
of the
kingdom
-
of God.
* ~ to those
* but
-
outside
in
parables
-
everything
comes,
in order that
seeing
they may see
and
not
they may ~ perceive,
and
hearing
they may hear
and
not
they may understand,
lest
they should turn
and
it should be forgiven
them.
and
he says
to them,
* not
* do you ~ know [the meaning of]
-
* ~ parable,
* this
and
how
all
the
parables
will you come to know?
the one
sowing
the
word
sows.
* ~ these
* and
are
the ones
beside
the
road,
where
is sown
the
word,
and
when
they hear [it],
immediately
comes
-
Satan
and
takes
the
word,
-
having been sown
in
them.
and
these
are
the ones
upon
the
rocky places
being sown,
who
when
they hear
the
word
immediately
with
joy
receive
it,
and
* not
* they do ~ have
a root
in
themselves
but
* ~ transitory,
* are
then
* comes about
* [when] tribulation ~
or
persecution
on account of
the
word
immediately
they fall away.
and
others
are
the ones
among
the ones
thorns
being sown.
these
are
the ones
the ones
word
having heard,
and
the
worries
of the
age
and
the
seduction
-
of wealth
and
the
for
the
remaining things
desires
coming in
choke
the
word
and
unfruitful.
* it becomes
and
those
are
the ones
upon
the
soil
-
good
having been sown
who
hear
the
word
and
receive [it]
and
bear fruit
one
thirty
and
one
sixty
and
one
one hundred.
and
he was saying
to them,
surely
is [not] brought [out]
the
lamp
in order that
under
the
measuring bucket
it may be placed
or
under
the
couch?
nor
that
upon
the
lampstand
it may be placed?
* not
* for
* ~ there is ~ [anything]
hidden
except
*
that
it may be revealed
nor
has it become
hidden
but
that
it may come
into
[the] open.
if
anyone
has
ears
to hear
let him hear.
and
he was saying
to them,
consider
what
you hear.
by
what
measure
you measure
it will be measured
to you
and
it will be added
to you
~ who[ever]
* for
has,
it will be given
to him,
and
who [ever]
* not
* does ~ have,
even
what
he has
will be taken away
from
him.
and
he was saying,
thus
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a man
might throw
the
seed
upon
the
soil
and
he might sleep
and
rise
night
and
day,
and
the
seed
sprouts
and
grows up
in such a way so that
* not
* he does ~ know
it.
on its own
the
soil
bears fruit,
first
grass
then
a head of grain
then
full
wheat
in
the
head.
* ~ when
* but
permits
the
crop,
immediately
he puts forth
the
sickle,
for
has come
the
harvest.
and
he was saying,
to what
should  we compare
the
kingdom
-
of God
or
by
what
it
parable
may we present?
as
a seed,
mustard
which
when
it is sown
on
the
earth,
*smaller
*being
*  [than] all
of the
seeds
-
on
the
earth,
and
when
it is sown
it grows up
and
becomes
greater [than]
all
of the
vegetables
and
makes
* ~ branches,
* large
so as
to make [it] possible [for]
under
the
shade
of it
the
birds
-
of heaven
to nest.
and
similar
parables
with many
he was speaking
to them
the
word
as
they were able
to hear.
* ~ apart from
* but
parables
* not
* he was ~ speaking
to them,
privately
*
however
-
to [his] own
disciples
he was explaining
everything.
and
he says
to them
on
that
-
day
* ~ evening,
* as it had become
let us go over
to
the
other side.
and
leaving
the
crowd
they take
him
as
he was
in
the
boat,
and
other
boats
were
with
him.
and
there came about
* ~ gust
* a fierce
of wind
and
the
waves
were beating
against
the
boat,
so that
already
to be filled
the
boat.
and
he
was
in
the
stern
on
the
cushion
sleeping.
and
they rouse
him
and
they say
to him,
teacher,
* not
* does it ~ matter
to you
that
we are perishing?
and
having been aroused
he rebuked
the
wind
and
he spoke
to the
lake,
be still,
be silenced,
and
died down
the
wind
and
there was
* ~ calm.
* a great
and
he said
to them,
why
cowardly?
are you
~ still not ~
do you ~ have
faith?
and
they were afraid
* ~ fear
* with a terrible
and
they wee saying
to
one another,
who
then
* ~ this
* is
that
even
the
wind
and
the
lake
obey
him?
and
they came
to
the
other side
of the
lake
to
the
country
of the
Gerasenes.
and
* ~ having come
* he
out
of the
boat
immediately
met
him
out of
the
tombs
a man
with
* ~ spirit,
* an unclean
who
the ( his)
dwelling
had
in
the ( his)
tombs,
and
not [even]
with a chain
any longer
was any one ~
* able
* ~ him.
* to bind
because
-
he
often
with shackles
and
chains
had been bound
and
had been torn apart
by
him
the
chains
and
the
shackles
had been smashed,
and
no one
was strong [enough]
~ him.
* to subdue
and
constantly
*
night
and
day
among
the
tombs
and
in
the
mountains
he was ~
crying out
and
beating
himself
with stones.
and
having seen
-
Jesus
from
afar
he ran
and
bowed down before
him.
and
having cried out
* ~ voice
* with a loud
he says,
what
to me
and
to you,
Jesus
son
-
of God
-
most high?
I implore
you
-
by God,
[do] not
me,
torment
* ~ he was saying
* for
to him,
come out,
-
spirit
-
unclean
from
the
man.
and
he was questioning
him,
what [is]
name?
your
and
he says
to him,
legion [is]
name.
my
for
many,
we are
and
he was imploring
him
greatly
that
not
them
he send
out
of the
country.
there was
now
there
near
the
mountain
herd
of pigs
a great
feeding
and
they implored
him
saying,
send
us
into
the
pigs,
so that
into
them
we may enter.
and
he permitted
them,
and
having come out,
the
spirits
-
unclean
entered
into
the
pigs,
and
rushed
the
herd
down
the
slope
into
the
lake,
about
two thousand,
and
were drowned
into
the
lake.
and
the ones
feeding
them
fled
and
reported [it]
in
the
city
and
in
the
farms.
and
they came
to see
what
is
the [thing]
having come to pass
and
they come
to
-
Jesus
and
they see
the one
being demon ~ possessed
sitting
having been clothed
and
being of sound mind,
the one
having had
the
legion,
and
they were afraid.
and
they described
to them
the ones
having seen
how
it happened
to the
demon - possessed [man]
and
about
the
pigs.
and
they began
to implore
him
to leave
from
the
region
of them.
and
while ~ is embarking
he
into
the
boat,
was begging
him
the one
having been demon -possessed
that
with
him
he might be .
and
* not
* he did ~permit
him,
but
says
to him,
go
to
the
house
of you
to
the ones [who are]
yours
and
report
to them
everything
the
Lord
*  ~ for you
* has done
and [that]
he had mercy upon
you.
and
he left
and
began
to preach
in
the
Decapolis
everything that
did
for him
-
Jesus,
and
everyone
was amazed.
and
having crossed over
-
Jesus
in
the

again
to
the

* a large
to
him,
and
he was
beside
the
lake.
and
comes
one
of the
synagogue leaders,
by name
Jairus,
and
having seen
him
he falls down
at
the

of him
and
he begs
him
earnestly
saying,

Jesus,
having come
in
the
crowd
behind
she touched
the
garment
of him.
she was saying
for ~
-
if
I may touch
even
the
garments
of him
I will be healed.
and
immediately
was dried up
the
fountain
of the
blood
of her
and
she knew
in the (her)
body
that
she has been cured
from
the
terrible affliction.
and
immediately
-
Jesus
having known
within
himself
the
from
him
power
having gone out
having turned around
in
the
crowd
he was saying,
who

* touched

garments?
and
were saying
to him
the
disciples
of him,
you see
the
crowd
pressing against
you,
and
you say,

and
he was looking around
to see

and
trembling,
having known
what
had happened
to her,
she came
and

they departed
in
the
boat
to
a desolate
place
* privately.
*
and
saw
them
going
and
knew [where they were going]
many
and
on foot
from
all
of the
towns
they ran
there
and
they arrived ahead of
them.
and
having gotten out [of the boat]
he saw
a large
crowd
and
he had compassion
on
them,
for
they were
like
sheep
* ~ having
* not
a shepherd,
and
he began
to teach
them
many things.
and
already
* ~ hour
* a late
was coming [and]
was approaching
him
the
disciples
of him
were saying
-
desolate
is
the
place
and
already [it is]
* ~ hour.
* a late
send away
them,
in order that
having departed
to
the
surrounding
farms
and
villages
they may buy
for themselves
what
they may eat.
-
but
having answered
he said
to them,
give
to them
yourselves [something]
to eat.
and
they say
to him,
having departed
may we buy
* ~ denarii
* for two hundered
loaves
and
will we give
to them
to eat?
-
and
he says
to them,
how many
loaves
do you have?
go [and]
see.
and
having known
they say,
five,
and
two
fish.
and
he commanded
them
to lie down
everyone
* group ~
* by group
on
the
green
grass.
and
they reclined
* group ~
* by group
in
hundreds
and
in
fifties.
and
having taken
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish
having looked up
to
-
heaven
he blessed
and
broke
the
loaves
and
he was giving [them]
to the
disciples
of him
in order that
they might set before
them,
and
the
two
fish
he divided
to all.
and
* ~ ate
* everyone
and
they were satisfied,
and
they picked up
fragments
twelve
* ~ baskets
* full
and
from
the
fish.
and
were
the ones
having eaten
the
loaves
five thousand
men.
and
immediately
he compelled
the
disciples
of him
to embark
into
the
boat
and
to go before [him]
to
the
other side
to
Bethsaida,
until
he
dismisses
the
crowd.
and
having said farewell
to them
he departed
to
the
mountain
to pray.
and
evening
having come
was
the
boat
in
[the] middle
of the
lake,
and
he
alone [was]
on
the
land.
and
having seen
them
straining
in
the
rowing,
was
for
the
wind
against
them,
about
[the] fourth
watch
of the
night
he comes
to
them
walking
on
the
lake.
and
he wanted
to go by
them.
-
but
having seen
him
on
the
lake
walking
they thought
that
* ~ an apparition,
* it is
and
they cried out;
* ~ everyone
* for
* ~ him
* saw
and
they were terrified.
-
and
immediately
he spoke
with
them,
and
he says
to them,
have courage,
I
am;
* do not ~
* be afraid.
and
he went up
to
them
in
the
boat
and
died down
the
wind,
and
very much
* exceedingly
*
in
themselves
they were amazed.
* did not
* for ~
* they ~ understand
concerning
the
loaves,
but
had been
their
-
heart
hardened.
and
having crossed over
onto
the
land
they came
to
Genesaret
and
anchored [there].
and
* ~ having come out
* they
from
the
boat,
immediately
having recognized
him,
they ran around
whole
-
region
that
and
they began
upon
-
mattresses
the ones
illness
having
to carry
where
they heard
that
he is (was).
and
* wherever
*
he was entering
into
villages
or
into
cities
or
into
countryside,
in
the
marketplaces
they were putting
the ones
having sickness
and
they were begging
him
that
even if
the
edge
of the
garment
of him
they might touch.
and
* as many ~
* as
touched
him
they were being healed.
and
comes together
to
him
the
Pharisees
and
some
of the
scribes
having come
from
Jerusalem
and
having seen
some
of the
disciples
of him
that
with impure
hands
*that ~

and
other things

there is (are)
which
they received
to hold to

and
question
him

*why

of you
according to
the
tradition
of the

but
with impure

and
he said
to them

and
they worship
me

[as] teachings
[the] commandments
of men
having abandoned
the
commandment
-
of god
you are holding to
the
tradition
-
of men
and
he was saying
to them
* ~well enough
* you have set aside
the
commandment
-
of god
in order that
the
traditions
of you
might stand

the
word
-
of god
by the
tradition
of you
which
you received
and
similar things
such
many
you do
and
having summoned
again
the
crowd
he was saying
to them
listen
to me
everyone
and
understand
* ~nothing
* there is
outside
of the
man
entering
into
him
which
is able
to defile
him
but
the things
of
the
man
coming out
are
the things
defiling
the
man
and
when
he entered
into
a house
from
the
crowd
were asking
him
the
disciples
of him [about]
the
parable
and
he says
to them
thus
also
you
without understanding
are
*do you not ~
* understand
that
*everything
*
outside
entering
into
the
man
* not
* is ~ able

of him
into
the
heart
but
into
the

and
into
the
latrine
goes out
cleansing
all

foods
* ~he was saying
* and
-
the thing
out of
the
man
going out
that

from there
and
having arisen
he departed
to
the
district
of Tyre
and
having entered
into
a house
* ~no one
* he wanted
to know
and[yet]
* not
* he was ~ able
to escape notice
but
immediately
* ~having heard
* a woman
about
him
of whom
was having
the
daughter
of her
* ~spirit
* an unclean
having come
she fell down
at
the
feet
of him
* ~the

woman
was having
a Greek
a Syrophoenician
-
by race
and
she was asking
him
that
the
demon
he might cast out
from within
the
daughter
of her
and
he was saying
to her
* ~allow
* first
to be satisfied
the
children
not
for
it is
good
to take
the
bread
of the
children
and
to the
dogs
to throw[it]
-
but
she answered
and
says
to him
lord
even
the
dogs
under
the
table

from
the
crumbs
of the
children
and
he said
to her
because of
this
-
word
word
has gone out
from
the
daughter
of you
the
demon
and
having departed
to
the
house
of her
she found
the
child
having been lying
on
the
couch
and
the
demon
having gone out
and
again
having come out
from
the
region
of Tyre
he came
through
Sidon
to
the
lake
-
of Galilee
in
the midst
of the
region
of Decapolis
and
they bring
to him [a man who was]
deaf
and
mute
and
they beg
him
that
he might put upon
him
the(his)
hand
and
having taken aside
him
from
the
crowd
*
* privately
he put
the
fingers
of him
into
the
ears
of him
and
having spit
he touched
the
tongue
of him
and
having looked up
to
-
heaven
he sighed
and
says
to him
ephphatha
which
means
be opened
and
immediately
was opened
his
-
ears
and
was loosened
the
bond
of the
tongue
of him
and
he was speaking
properly
and
he was ordering
them
that
* ~no one
* they should tell
as much as
but ~
them
he ordered
they
the more
all
were proclaiming[it]
and
* beyond all measure
* they were amazed~
saying
well
all things
he has done
and
the
deaf
he makes
to hear
and
the
mute
to speak
in
those
-
days
again
a large
crowd
being
and
not
having
anything
they might eat
having called
the
disciples
he says
to them
I have compassion
on
the
crowd
because of
already
* ~ days
* three
they have remained with
me
and
* not
* they do ~ have
anything
they may eat
and
if
I send away
them
hungry
to
[the] house
of them
they will give out
on
the
way
and
some
of them
from
far away
have come
and
answered
him
the
disciples
of him
-
from where
these ones
will be able
anyone
here
to feed
loaves
in
a desolate place
and
he was asking
them
how many
*~ do you have
* loaves
-
and
they said
seven
and
he gives orders
to the
crowd
to recline
on
the
ground
and
having taken
the
seven
loaves
[and] having given thanks
he broke [them]
and
was giving [them]
to the
disciples
of him
so that
they might serve
and
they served
the
crowd
and
they were having
* ~fish
* a few
and
having blessed
them
he said
also
these [are]
to be served
and
they ate
and
were satisfied
and
took up
an abundance
of pieces
seven
baskets [full]
* ~there were
* and
approximately
for thousand [people]
and
he sent away
them
and
immediately
having embarked
into
the
boat
with
the
disciples
of him
he came
into
the
region
of Dalmanutha
and
came out
the
Pharisees
and
they began
to argue
with him
seeking
from
him
a sign
from
-
heaven
trying
him
and
having sighed deeply
in the
spirit
of him
he says
why
-
generation
this
does seek
a sign
truly
I say
to you
in no way
will be given
-
* ~generation
* to this
a sign
and
having left
them
again
having embarked
he departed
to
the
other side
and
they forgot
to take
loaves
and
except
*
one
loaf
not
they did have [anything]
with
themselves
in
the
boat
and
he was giving orders
to them
saying
take care
beware
of
the
leaven
of the
Pharisees
and
the
leaven
of Herod
and
they were arguing
among
themselves
-
* ~loaves
* not
* they do ~  have [any]
and
having known[this]
he says
to them
why
are you discussing
that
* ~loaves
* do not
* you ~ have
* not yet
* do you ~ understand
nor
having become comprehend
* hardened
* have you ~
the
heart
of you
eyes
having
not
do you see
and
ears
having
not
do you hear
and
* not
* do you ~  remember
when
the
five
loaves
I broke
for
the
five thousand
how many
baskets
of pieces
full
you picked up
they say
to him
twelve
when
the
seven
for
the
four thousand
how many
baskets
full
of pieces
you picked up
and
they say
to him
seven
and
he was saying
to them
* not yet
* do you ~  comprehend
and
they come
to
Bethsaida
and
they bring
to him
a blind [man]
and
they beg
him
that
* ~him
* he might touch
and
having grasped
the
hand
of the
blind [man]
he took
him
outside
the
village
and
having spit
in
the
eyes
of him [and]
having put
the(his)
hands
[on] him
he was questioning
him
if
* ~anything
* you see
and
having looked up
he was saying
I see
-
men
that
as
trees
I see
walking
then
again
he placed
the(his)
hands
on
the
eyes
of him
and
he opened his eyes
and
he was restored
and
he was seeing
* ~clearly
* everthing
and
he sent
him
to
[the] house
of him
saying
not
into
the
village
you may go
and
went out
-
Jesus
and
the
disciples
of him
to
the
villages
of Caesarea
-
of Philip
and
on
the
way
he was questioning
the
disciples
of him
saying
to them
whom
whom
saying
-
men
to be
-
and
they spoke
to him
saying
-
John
the
baptist
and
others
Elijah
* ~others
* but
that
one
of the
prophets
and
he
questioned
them
* ~you
* but
whom
* ~me
* do you say
to be
having answered
-
Peter
says
to him
you
are
the
Chirist
and
he warned
them
that
no one
they should tell
about
him
and
he began
to teach
them
that
it is necessary [for]
the
son
-
of man
* ~many things
* to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
to be killed
and
after
three
days
to rise
and
with plainness
the
word
he was speaking
he was speaking
having taken aside
-
Peter
him
began
to rebuke
him
-
and
having turned around
and
having seen
the
disciples
of him
he rebuked
Peter
and
says
go away
behind
me
Satan
because
* not
* you are ~  thinking
the things
-
of god
but
the things
-
of men
and
having called together
the
crowd
along with
the
disciples
of him
he said
to them
if
someone
desires
after
me
to follow
let him deny
himself
and
let him take up
the
cross
of him
and
let him follow
me
whoever
for ~
*
desires
the
life
of him
to save
he will lose
it
* ~whoever
* but
*
loses
the
life
of him
for the sake
of me
and
the
good news
will save
it
* ~what
* for
does it benefit
a man
to gain
the
* ~world
* whole
and
to forfeit
the
life
of him
* ~what
* for
may give
a man
in exchange [for]
the
life
of him
* ~whoever
* for
*
*
me
and
-
my
words
in exchange [for]
-
generation
this
-
adulterous
and
sinful
also
the
son
-
of man
will be ashamed of
him
when
he comes
in
the
glory
of the
father
of him
with
the
angels
-
holy
and
he was saying
to them
truly
I say
to you
that
there are
someone
here
of the ones
having stood
who
* by no means
*
will taste
death
* until
*
they see
the
kingdom
-
of god
having come
in
power
and
after
* ~days
* six
takes
-
Jesus
-
Peter
and
-
James
and
-
John
and
leads
them
to
mountain
a high
privately
*
alone
and
he was transfigured
before
them
and
the
garments
of him
became
shining
white
exceedingly
of such a kind
a bleacher
on
-
earth
not
is able
thus
to whiten
and
appeared
to them
Elijah
along with
Moses
and
they were
talking with
-
Jesus
and
having answered
-
Peter
says
-
to Jesus
rabbi
good
 [for] it is ~
us
* ~here
* to be
and
let us make
three
tents
* ~for you
* one
and
* ~ for Moses
* one
and
* ~ for Elijah
* one
~ not ~
for ~
he had known
what
he answered
terrified
for
they were
and
there came
a cloud
overshadowing
them
and
there came
a voice
out from
the
cloud
this
is
the
son
of me
the
beloved
listen
to him
and
suddenly
having looked around
no longer
anyone
they saw
but
-
Jesus
alone
with
themselves
and
* ~coming down
* [as] they were
from
the
mountain
he gave orders
to them
that
no one
what
they saw
they should tell
*except
*
when
the
son
-
of man
from
[the] dead
should arise
and
the
word
they kept
to
themselves
discussing
what
means
-
from
[the] dead
to rise
and
they were questioning
him
saying
why
say
the
scribes
that
* ~ Elijah
* it is necessary for
to come
first
-
and
he said
to them
Elijah
indeed
having come
first
restores
everything
and
how
has it been written
concerning
the
son
-
of man
that
* ~many things
* he must suffer
and
be rejected
but
I say
to you
that
indeed
Elijah
has come
and
they did
to him
whatever
they were desiring
just as
it has been writen
concerning
him
and
having come
to
the
disciples
they saw
* ~crowd
* a great
around
them
and
[the] scribes
arguing
with
them
and
immediately
all
the
crowd
having seen
him
were amazed
and
running up to [him]
they were greeting
him
and
he questioned
them
what
are you arguing
with
them
and
answered
him
one
of
the
crowd
teacher
I brought
the
son
of me
to
you
having
* ~spirit
* a mute
and
*wherever
*
* ~him
* it seizes
it throws down
him
and
he foams at the mouth
and
gnashes
the(his)
teeth
and
he becomes stiff
and
I told
the
disciples
of you
in order that
it
they might cast out
and
* not
* they were ~  strong enough
-
and
having answered
them
he says
o
* ~generation
* faithless
* how
* long
with
you
will I be
* how
*  long
will I put up whith
you
bring
him
to
me
and
they brought
him
to
him
and
having seen
him
the
spirit
immediately
convulsed
him
and
having fallen
on
the
ground
he was rolling around
foaming at the mouth
and
he questioned
the
father
of him
how long [in]
time
is it
while
this
has happened
to him
-
and
he said
from
childhood
and
often
also
into
[the] fire
* ~him
* it threw
and
into
[the] waters
that
it might destroy
him
but
if
* ~anything
* you can do
help
us
having compassion
upon
us
-
and
Jesus
said
to him
-
if
you are able
all things
are possible
for the one
believing
* ~immediately
* having cried out
the
father
of the
child
was saying
I believe
help
my
-
unbelief
having seen
and
and
Jesus
that
* ~is running together
* a crowd
commanded
the
spirit
-
unclean
saying
to it
-
mute
and
deaf
spirit
I
commanded
you are able
come out
from
him
and
no more
may you enter
into
him
and
having cried out
and
* ~greatly
* having convulsed [him]
it came out
and
he was rolling around
like
a dead [person]
of that
-
many [were led]
to say
that
he died
-
but
Jesus
having grasped
the
hand
of him
lifted up
him
and
he stood up
and
* ~having entered
* he
into
a house
the
disciples
of him
*
* privately
were questioning
him
why
we
not
were able
to cast out
it
and
he said
to them
this
-
kind
by
nothing
is able
to be cast out
* except
*
by
prayer
and from there
having gone forth
they were passing
through
-
Galilee
and
not
he did ~ want
that
anyone
should know
he was teaching
for ~
the
disciples
of him
and
was saying
to them
-
the
son
-
of man
is betrayed
into
[the] hands
of men
and
they will kill
him
and
having been killed
after
three
days
he will arise
* ~they
* but
were not understanding
the
word
and
they were afraid
* ~him
* to ask
and
they came
into
Capernaum
and
in
the
house
being
he was questionning
them
what
on
the
way
were you arguing about

* but
were being silent
with
one another
for
they argued
on
the
way [about]
who [was]

having sat down
he called
the
twelve
and
he says
to them
if
someone
desires
first
to become
he will be
* ~of all
* last
and
* ~of all
* a servant
and
having taken
a child
he set
him
in
[the] middle
of them
and
having taken into his arms
him
he said
to them
*whoever
*

* ~me

the one

said
to him

it is

as
he was accustomed

having approached
Pharisees
they were asking
him
if
it is permissible for
a husband

him

but
having answered
he said
to them
what [did]
you

Moses
* ~they

said
* ~permitted [a man]
* Moses
a certificate
of divorce

to divorce [his wife]

to them

[even] more
were amazed

Jesus,
and
they were astounded,

were afraid.
and
having taken
again
the
twelve
he began
* ~ to them

* about

* to happen
-
behold
we go up
to
Jerusalem,
and
the
son

of man
will be betrayed
to the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
they will condemn
him
to death
and
will deliver
him
to the
gentiles
and
they will ridicule
him
and
spit on
him
and
whip
him
and
will kill [him],
and
after
three
days
he will rise again.
and
approached
him
James
and
John,
the
sons
of Zebedee,
saying
to him,
teacher,
we wish
that
* whatever
*
we may ask
you
you may do
for us.
-
and
he said
to them,
what
do you wish
me [that]
I may do
for you?
-
and
they said
to him,
grant
to us
that
one
* ~ your
* on
right
and
one
on [your]
left
we may sit
in
the
glory
of you.
-
but
Jesus
said
to them,
* not
*  you do ~  know
what
you ask.
are you able
to drink
the
cup
which
I
drink
or
the
baptism

I

-
and
they said
to him,
we are able
-
and
Jesus
said
to them,
the
cup
which
I
drink
you will drink
and
the
baptism
which
I
am baptized [with]
you will be baptized [with]

but
to sit

or
on [my]

me
to grant,
but
for the ones
it has been prepared.
and
having heard
the
ten
became
angry
with
James
and
John.
and
having summoned
them
-
Jesus
says
to them,
you know
that
the ones
having a reputation
to rule
the
gentiles
lord it over
them
and
the
great ones
of them
exercise authority over
them.
not
so
however,
it is
with
you,
but
* whoever
*
wishes
* ~ great
* to become
among
you,
he must be [the]
* ~ of you,

wishes

to
Jericho.

the
son
of Timaeus
Bartimaeus,
a blind
beggar,
was sitting down
beside
the
road.
and
having heard
that
Jesus
the
Nazarene
is (was) [coming]
he began
to cry out
and
to say,
son
of David
Jesus,
have mercy on
me.
and
were rebuking
him
many
that
he should be silent.
-
but
much
more
he was crying out,
son
of David,
have mercy on
me.
and
having stood
-
Jesus
said,
call
him.
and
they called
the
blind man
saying
to him,
be cheerful,
stand up,
he is calling
you.
-
and
having tossed aside
the
garment
of him [and]
having jumped up
he came
to
-
Jesus.
and
having answered
him
-
Jesus
said,
what
for you
do you wish
that I may do?
* ~ the
* and
blind man
said
to him,
rabboni,
that
I may see.
and
-
Jesus
said
to him,
go,
the
faith
of you
has restored
you.
and
immediately
he saw again
and
he was following
him
on
the
road.
and
when
they draw near
to
Jerusalem
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
to
the
mount
-
of olives,
he sends
two
of the
disciples
of him
and
he says
to them,
go
into
the
village
-
opposite
of you,
and
immediately
entering
into
it
you will find
a colt
having been tied,
upon
which
no one
not yet
of men
sat.
untie
it
and
bring [it].
and
if
someone
to you
says
why
are you doing
this?
say,
the
lord
of it
need
has,
and
immediately
he ~
sends (it)
again
here.
and
they left
and
found
a colt
having been tied
to
a door
out
on
the
street
and
they untie
him.
and
some
of the ones
* ~ there
* having been standing
were saying
to them,
what
are you doing
untying
the
colt?
-
and
they spoke
to them
just as
told [them]
-
Jesus,
and
they permitted
them.
and
they bring
the
colt
to
-
Jesus
and
they lay upon
it
the
garments
of them,
and
he sat
upon
it.
and
many
the
garments
of them
spread
on
the
road,
* ~ others
* but
leafy branches
having cut
from
the
fields.
and
the ones
leading the way
and
the ones
following
were crying out,
hosanna!
having been blessed
the one
coming
in [the]
name
of [the] lord.
having been blessed
the
coming
kingdom
of the
father
of us
David.
hosanna
in
the
highest.
and
he entered
into
Jerusalem
into
the
temple
and
having looked around
everywhere,
late
now
being
the
hour,
he went out
to
Bethany
with
the
twelve.
and
on the
next day
* ~ having gone out
* they
from
Bethany,
he was hungry.
and
having seen
a fig tree
from
a distance
having
leaves
he came [to see],
* whether
*
* ~ something
* he might find
on
it,
and
having come
upon
it
* ~ nothing
*  he found
* except
*
leaves.
* ~ the
* for
season
* not [for]
* was
figs.
and
having answered
he said
to it,
no longer
into
the
age
from
you
no one
* ~ fruit.
* may eat [the]
and
were listening
the
disciples
of him.
and
they come
to
Jerusalem.
and
having entered
into
the
temple,
he began
to drive out
the ones
selling
and
the ones
buying
in
the
temple,
and
the
tables
of the
money changers
and
the
chairs
of the ones
selling
the
doves
he overturned,
and
* not
* he was ~ allowing
that
anyone
should carry
things
through
the
temple.
and
he was teaching
and
he was saying
to them,
* not
* has it ~  been written
-
the
house
of me
a house
of prayer
will be called
[for] all
the
gentiles?
* ~ you
* but
have made
it
a refuge
of robbers.
and
heard [this]
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
they were seeking
how
him
they might destroy
they were afraid
for ~
of him,
all
for ~
the
crowd
were amazed
at
the
teaching
of him.
and
when
late,
it became
they were going forth
outside
the
city.
and
passing by
early
they saw
the
fig tree
having been withered
from [the]
roots.
and
having remembered
-
Peter
says
to him,
rabbi,
look,
the
fig tree
which
you cursed
has been withered.
and
having answered
-
Jesus
says
to them,
have
faith
in god.
truly
I say
to you
that
* whoever
*
says
-
mountain,
to this
be lifted up
and
be thrown
into
the
sea,
and
not
does waver
in
the
heart
of him
but
believes
that
what
he says
happens,
it will be [so]
for him.
for ~ reason
this
I say
to you,
everything
which
you pray
and
ask,
believe
that
you received [it],
and
it will be [so]
for you.
and
when
you stand
praying,
forgive
if
something
you have
against
someone,
in order that
also
the
father
of you,
the one
in
the
heavens,
may forgive
you
the
transgressions
of you.
and
they come
again
into
Jerusalem.
and
in
the
temple
[when] walking about,
he
come
to
him
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders
and
they were saying
to him,
by
what kind of
authority
do these things?
you do
or
who
to you
gave
-
authority
this
that
these things?
you may do
-
but
Jesus
said
to them,
I will ask
you
one
word (question),
and
you answer
me
and
I will tell
you
by
what kind of
authority
these things.
I do
the
baptism

of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men?
answer
me.
and
they were discussing
with
themselves
saying,
if
we say,
from
heaven,
he will say,
* why
*
then
*  not
*  did you ~ believe
him?
but [if]
we say
from
* men?-
* they were afraid of
the
crowd.
* ~ everyone
* for
was considering

John
really
that

* he was
and
having answered
-
Jesus
they say,
* not
* we do ~ know.
and
-
Jesus
says
to them,
neither
I
tell
you
by
what kind of
authority

* I do
and
he began
to them
in
parables
to speak,
a vineyard
a man
planted
and
he put around [it]
a fence
and
dug
a trough
and
built
a tower
and
he leased
it
to farmers
and
he went on a journey.
and
he sent
to
the
farmers
in the
season [of harvest]
a slave
in order that
from
the
farmers
he might receive
from
the
fruits
of the
vineyard.
and
having taken
him
they beat [him]
and
sent [him] away
empty.
and
again
he sent
to
them
another
slave;
and that one
they struck on the head
and
insulted.
and
another;
he sent ~
and that one
they killed,
and
many
others,
* some
*
beating,
* ~ others
* and
killing.
still
* ~ one

he sent
him
finally
to
them
saying
-
they will respect
the
son
of me.
* ~ those

farmers
to
themsleves
said
-
this one
is
the
heir.
come
let us kill
him,
and
ours
will be
them
inheritance.
and
having seized [him]
they killed
him
and
threw out
him
outside
of the
vineyard.
what
then
will do
the
master
of the
vineyard?
he will come
and
destroy
the
farmers
and
will give
the
vineyard
to others.

they send
to
him
some
of the

they
Herodians
in order that

in a word.
and
having come
they say
to him,

and
they brought [one].
and
he says
to them,
whose

image [is]
this
and [whose]

and
they said
to him,
Caesar's.

and
Jesus
said
to them,

the things

they were amazed
at

and

are they given in marriage,
but
they are
like
angels
in
the
heavens.
* ~ concerning
* but
the
dead
that
they are raised
* not
* have you ~ read
in
the
book
of Moses
at
the
thornbush
how
spoke
to him
-
god
saying,
I [am]
the
god
of Abraham
and
the
god
of Isaac
and
the
god
of Jacob?
not 
he is
[the] God
of dead [persons]
but

* ~ greatly.
* you are mistaken
and
having approached
one
of the
scribes
having heard
them
debating,
having seen
that
well
he answered
them
asked
him,
which
is
*  ~ commandment
* [the] first
of all?
answered
-
Jesus
-
[the] first
is,
hear,
[o] Israel,
[the] lord
-
god
of us,
* ~ lord
* one
is,
and
you shall love
[the] lord
the
god
of you
from
[the] whole
of the

of you
and
from
[the] whole
of the
soul
of you
and
from
[the] whole
of the

of you
and
from
[the] whole
of the
strength
of you.
[the] second
is [this],
you shall love
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself.
greater [than]
these
another
commandment
* ~ not.
* there is
and
said
to him
the
scribe,
well,
teacher,
on the basis of
truth
you say
that
* ~ one
* there is
and
* ~ not
* there is
another
except
him.
and
-
to love
him
from
[the] whole
of the
heart
and
from
[the] whole
of the
intelligence
and
from
[the] whole
of the
strength
and
-
to love
the
neighbor
as
himself
* ~ greater [than]
* is
all
of the
burnt offerings
and
sacrifices.
and
-
Jesus
having seen
him
that
* ~ wisely
* he answered
said
to him,
not
far
you are
from
the
kingdom
-
of god.
and
no one
any longer
was daring
* ~ him.
* to question
and
having answered
-
Jesus
was saying
[when] teaching
in
the
temple,
how
say
the
scribes
that
the
Christ
[the] son
of David
is?
* ~ himself
* David
said
by
the
spirit
-
holy,
* ~ said
* [the] lord
to the
lord
of me,
sit
at
[the] right
of me,
* until
*
I put
the
enemies
of you
under
the
feet
of you.
* ~ himself
* David
calls
him
lord,
and
how
*
* is he
[his] son?
and
the
huge
crowd
was listening
him
gladly.
and
in
the
teaching
of him
he was saying,
beware
of
the
scribes,
the ones
desiring
in
long robes
to walk about
and
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
and
chief seats
in
the
synagogues
and
places of honor
at
the
banquets,
the ones
devouring
the
houses
of the
widows
and
for show
*  ~ long [prayers].
* praying ~
these ones
will receive
greater
judgment.
and
having sat [down]
opposite
the
treasury
he was observing
how
the
crowd
throws
copper [coins]
into
the
treasury.
and
many
rich people
were throwing [in]
much.
and
having come
one
* ~ widow,
* poor
she threw [in]
* ~ leptas,
* two
which
is
a kodrantes.
and
having summoned
the
disciples
of him
he said
to them,
truly
I say
to you
that
-
widow
this
-
poor
more [than]
all
threw [in]
the ones
throwing
into
the
treasury.
everyone
for
from
the
abounding
to them
threw [in],
this [widow]
but
from
the
need
of her
everything
as much as
she had
she put [in]
all
the
living
of her.
and
* ~ going out
* he
from
the
temple
says
to him
one
of the
disciples
of him,
teacher,
look
what sort of
stones
and
what sort of
buildings.
and
-
Jesus
said
to him,
do you see
these
-
great
buildings?
by no means
*
will be left
here
a stone
on
a stone
which
* will not
*
* be thrown down.
and
* ~ sitting
* he
on
the
mount
-
of olives
opposite
the
temple
were questioning
him
*
* privately
Peter
and
James
and
John
and
Andrew,
tell
us
when
these things
will be
and
what [will be]
the
sign
when

these things
to be complete

-
and
Jesus
began
to say
to them,

and
to

and
when

it was
now

the [feast of]
unleavend bread
after
two
days.
and
were seeking
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
how
him
by
deceit
having seized
they might kill.
they were saying,
for

at
the
feast,
lest

and
they were reproaching

said,

she did.
she prepared ahead of time
to anoint
the

of me
for
the
burial.

I say
to you,
* wherever

and
Judas
Iscariot
-
one
of the
twelve
went
to
the
chief priests
in order that
* ~ him
* he might betray
to them.
* ~ the ones
* and
having heard
rejoiced
and
promised
him
money
to give.
and
he was seeking
how
him
conveniently
he might betray.
and
on the
first
day
of the [feast of]
unleavened bread,
when
the
passover [lamb]
was being sacrificed,
say
to him
the
disciples
of him,
where
do you wish
having gone
we may prepare
that
you may eat
the
passover [lamb]?
and
he sends
two
of the
disciples
of him
and
he says
to them,
go
into
the
city,
and
will meet
you
a man
a jar
of water
carrying;
follow
him
and
* wherever
*
he enters
tell
the
master of the house
that
the
teacher
says,
where
is
the
guest room
of me
where
the
passover
with
the
disciples
of me
I may eat?
and
he
you
will show ~
upstairs room
a large
having been furnished [and]
ready.
and
there
prepare [the meal]
for us.
and
went out
the
disciples
and
they came
into
the
city
and
found [things]
just as
he told
them
and
they prepared
the
passover [lamb].
and
evening
having come
he comes
with
the
twelve.
and
~ reclining
they
and
eating
-
Jesus
said,
truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
me
the one
eating
with
me.
they began
to be sorrowful
and
to say
to him
one
by
one,
[surely] not
I?
-
and
he said
to them,
one
of the
twelve,
the one
dipping
with
me
into
the
bowl.
for
the
-
son
-
of man
goes
just as
it has been written
concerning
him,
* ~ woe
* but
-
* ~ man
* to that
through
whom
the
son
-
of man
is betrayed.
[it would have been] better
for him
if
not
had been born
-
man.
that
and
* ~ eating
* they
having taken
bread [and]
having blessed [it]
he broke [it]
and
gave [it]
to them
and
said,
take [it]
this
is
the
body
of me.
and
having taken
a cup [and]
having given thanks
he gave [it]
to them,
and
drank
of
it
everyone.
and
he said
to them,
this
is
the
blood
of me
of the
covenant
the [blood which]
is being poured out
for
many.
truly
I say
to you
that
no longer
not
at all (by any means)
I will drink
of
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
-
* ~ day
* that
when
* ~ it
* I drink
new
in
the
kingdom
-
of god.
and
having sung a hymn
they went out
to
the
mount
-
of olives.
and
says
to them
-
Jesus
-
every [one of]
you will fall away,
for
it has been written,
I will strike down
the
shepherd,
and
the
sheep
will be scattered.
but
after
*
* ~ am raised
* I
I will go before
you
into
-
Galilee.
-
but
Peter
said
to him,
if
even
everyone
will fall away,
yet
not.
I [will]
and
says
to him
-
Jesus,
truly
I say
to you
that
you
today
this
-
night
* before
*
twice
a rooster
crows
three [times]
me
you will deny.
-
but
with great emphasis
he was saying,
if
it is necessary [for]
me
to die
for you,
* not
* by no means
* ~ you.
* will I deny
* ~ likewise
* and
also
everyone
spoke.
and
they come
to
a place
of which
the
name [was]
Gethsemane
and
he says
to the
disciples
of him,
sit down
here
while
I pray.
and
he takes
-
Peter
and
-
James
and
-
John
with
him
and
he began
to be distressed
and
to be troubled
and
he says
to them,
very sad
is
the
soul
of me
unto
death.
remain
here
and
stay awake.
and
having gone forth
a little
he was falling
on
the
ground
and
was praying
that
if
possible
it is
might pass away
from
him
the
hour,
and
he was saying,
abba
-
father,
all things [are]
possible
for you.
take away
-
* ~ cup
* this
from
me.
but
not
what
I
will
but
what
you [will].
and
he comes
and
finds
them
sleeping,
and
he says
-
to Peter,
Simon,
are you sleeping?
* not
* were you ~ strong [enough]
one
hour
to stay awake?
stay awake
and
pray
that
you
may not come
into
temptation.
the
indeed ~
spirit [is]
ready
the
but ~
flesh [is]
weak.
and
again
having gone away
he prayed
the
same
word
having said.
and
again
having come
he found
them
sleeping,
were
for
of them
them
eyes
falling shut
and
* not
* they did ~ know
what
they might answer
him.
and
he comes
-
a third [time]
and
says
to them,
sleep [for]
the
remainder
and
rest.
it is enough.
has come
the
hour,
behold
is betrayed
the
son
-
of man
into
the
hands
-
of sinners.
get up,
let us go,
behold
the
one betraying
me
has drawn near.
and
immediately
while
he
is speaking
arrives
Judas,
one
of the
twelve,
and
with
him
a crowd
with
swords
and
clubs
from
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
and
the
elders.
had given
now
the one
betraying
him
a signal
to them
saying,
* whomever
*
I may kiss
he
is [the one],
seize
him,
and
lead [him] away
under guard.
and
having come
immediately
having approached
him
he says,
rabbi,
and
he kissed
him.
-
and
they laid on
the (their)
hands
on him
and
arrested
him.
one
but
a certain
of the ones
having stood by
having drawn
the
sword,
struck
the
slave
of the
high priest
and
cut off
his
-
ear.
and
having answered
-
Jesus
said
to them,
as
against
a thief
do you come out
with
swords
and
clubs
to seize
me?
every
day
I was
with
you
in
the
temple
teaching
and
~ did not
you ~ arrest
me;
but
in order that
might be fulfilled
the
scriptures.
and
having left
him
fled.
everyone
and
young man
a certain
was following along with
him
having been clothed
with a linen garment
over [his]
naked [body],
and
they seize
him.
* ~ he
* but
having left behind
the
linen garment
* ~ naked.
* fled
and
they led away
-
Jesus
to
the
high priest,
and
gather together
all
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes.
and
-
Peter
from
a distance
followed
him
until
inside
in
the
courtyard
of the
high priest
and
* he was ~
* sitting together
with
the
servants
and
warming himself
near
the
light [of the fire].
* ~ the
* and
chief priests
and
[the] entire
-
council
were seeking
against
-
Jesus
a witness
in order to
-
put to death
him,
and
* not
* they were ~ finding [any].
* ~ many
* for
were testifying falsely
against
him,
and
identical
the
testimonies
* ~not.
* were
and
some
having stood up
were testifying falsely
against
him
saying
-
we
heard
him
saying
-
I
will destroy
-
* ~ temple
* this
-
made with human hands
and
after
three
days
another
not made with hands
I will build
and
not
so
identical
was
the
testimony
of them.
and
having stood up
the
high priest
in
[the] midst
questioned
-
Jesus
saying,
* not
* do you ~ answer
anything [to]
what
these
* ~ you?
* testify against
-
but
he was slient
and
* not
* did ~ answer
anything.
again
the
high priest
was questioning
him
and
he says
to him,
* ~ you
* are
the
Christ
the
son
of the
blessed one?
-
and
Jesus
said
I
am,
and
you will see
the
son
-
of man
at [the]
right [hand]
sitting
of the
power
and
coming
with
the
clouds
-
of heaven.
* ~ the
* and
high priest
having torn
the
tunic
of him
says,
what
further
need
do we have
of witnesses?
you heard
the
blasphemy.
how
* ~ to you?
* does it seem
* ~ they
* and
all
condemned
him
* ~ deserving
* to be
of death.
and
* ~ began
* some
to spit on
him
and
to cover
his
-
face
and
strike
him
and
to say
to him,
prophesy,
and
the
servants
with slaps
him
received.
and
being
-
Peter
below
in
the
courtyard,
comes
one
of the
maids
of the
high priest
and
having seen
-
Peter
warming himself,
having looked at
him
she says,
* ~ also
* you
with
the
Nazarene
were
-
Jesus.
-
but
he denied [it]
saying,
* not
* I do ~ know
nor
understand
* ~ you
* what
are saying.
and
he went out
outside
into
the
entryway
and
a rooster
crowed.
and
the
maid
having seen
him
began
again
to say
to the ones
having stood by
-
this one
of
them
is [one].
-
but
again
he was denying [it].
and
after
a little [while]
again
the ones
having stood by
were saying
-
to Peter,
truly
of
them
you are [one],
* ~ indeed
* for
* ~ a Galilean.
* you are
-
and
he began
to curse
and
to swear
-
* not
* I do ~ know
-
* ~ man
* this
of whom
you speak.
and
immediately
for
a second time
a rooster
crowed.
and
remembered
-
Peter
the
word
as
spoke
to him
-
Jesus
-
before
a rooster
crows
twice,
three [times]
* ~ me.
* you will deny
and
having broken down
he was crying.
and
immediately
early
* ~ a council,
* having prepared
the
chief priests
with
the
elders
and
scribes
and [the]
entire
-
council,
having bound
-
Jesus
they led [him] away
and
handed [him] over
to Pilate.
and
questioned
him
-
Pilate,
* ~ you
* are
the
king
of the
Jews?
-
and
having answered
him
he says,
* ~ yourself.
* you say [so]
and
were accusing
him
the
chief priests
[of] many things.
-
and
Pilate
again
questioned
him
saying,
* not
* do you ~ answer
anything?
look
how many things
* ~ you [of].
* they accuse
-
but
Jesus
no longer
*  ~ anything,
* answered
so as
to amaze
-
Pilate.
[at] every
now ~
festival
he used to release
to them
one
prisoner [for]
whom
they were begging.
* ~ there was
* now
the one
being called
Barabbas
with
the one
fellow insurrectionsts
having been bound,
who
in
the
uprising
* ~ murder.
* had committed
and
having gone up
the
crowd
began
to ask
just as
he used to do
for them.
-
but
Pilate
answered
them
saying,
do you wish [that]
I should release
to you
the
king
of the
Jews?
* ~ he knew
* for
that
because of
envy
had handed [him] over
to him
the
chief priests.
* ~ the
* but
chief priests
incited
the
crowd
that
rather
-
* ~ Barabbas
* he should release
to them.
-
but
Pilate
again
having answered
was saying
to them,
what
then
do you wish [that]
I should do [with the one]
whom
you call
the
king
of the
Jews?
-
and
again
they cried out,
crucify
him.
-
but
Pilate
was saying
to them,
* ~ what
* for
* ~ did he commit?
* evil
* ~ they
* but
all the more
cried out,
crucify
him.
-
so
Pilate,
desiring
the
crowd

*
released
to them
-
Barabbas,
and
handed over
-
Jesus
having scourged [him]
that
he might be crucified.

* and
soldiers
led away
him
into
the
courtyard,
which
is
[the] praetorium,
and
they call together [the]
whole

cohort.
and
they clothe
him [in]
purple
and
place upon
him
having been woven
a thorny
crown.
and
they began
to greet
him,
hail,
king
of the
Jews.
and
they were striking
him [on]
the
head
with a staff
and
they were spitting on
him
and
bending
the (their)
knees
they were bowing down before
him.
and
when
they ridiculed
him,
they stripped
him [of]
the
purple
and
clothed
him [in]
the
garments
of him.
and
they lead out
him
that
they might crucify
him.
and
they requisition
passing by
a certain
Simon,
a Cyrenian
coming
from [the]
countryside,
the
father
of Alexander
and
Rufus,
in order that
he might carry
the
cross
of him.
and
they bring
him
to
the
Golgotha
place [called],
which
means
being interpreted
of [the] skull
place
and
they were giving
to him

they crucify
him
and
divide
the

of him,
casting
a lot
for

and
with
him
they crucify
two

and
one
on [the]

of him.
and
the ones

and
saying,

and
building [it]
in

and
and
[the] child
was growing
and
was being strengthened
in spirit,
and
he was
in
the
desolate places
until
[the] day
of [the] manifestation
of him
to
-
Israel.
and it came about
*
in
-
those days
*
[that] a decree was sent out
*
from
Caesar
Augustus
to register
all
the
world
this
Census
was [the] first [taken while]

Syria
Quirinius
and
everyone was traveling

to register
each
to

his own

*
also
Joseph
from
-
Galilee
from
[the] city
Nazareth
to
-
Judea
to
[the] city
of David
which
is called
Bethlehem
because
-
he was
*
of
[the] house

of David
*to register
with
Mary
the one
having been engaged
to him
being
pregnant
it came about
and ~
while

were
they
there
were fulfilled
the
days
-
[for] her to bear
*
and
she bore
the
son
of her
the
firstborn
and
she wrapped in cloths
him
and
laid
him
in
a manger
because
there was not
*
for them
a place
in
the
inn
and
shepherds
were
in
the
region
-
same
living outside
and
keeping
watch
[during] the
night
over
the
flock
of them
*and
an angel
of [the] Lord
appeared
to them
and
[the] glory
of [the] Lord
shone around
them
and
they were afraid [with]
a great fear
*
and
said
to them
the
angel
not 
do be afraid
behold
for 
I announce good news
to you
[of] joy
great 
which
will be
to all
the
people
because

to you
today
a Savior
who
is

[the] Lord
in
[the] city
of David
and
this [will be]
to you
the
sign
you will find
an infant
having been wrapped in cloths
and
lying
in
a manger
and
suddenly
there was
with
the
angel
a multitude
of [the] heavenly army
*
praising
-
God
and
saying
Glory
in
[the] highest
to God
and
on
earth
peace
among
men
of goodwill
and
it came about
when
departed
from
them
to
-

the
angels
the
shepherds
were saying
to
one another
let us go
now
up to
Bethlehem
and
let us see

having made haste
and
they found

and
the
infant
lying
in
the
manger
and having seen [them]
*
they made known
concerning
the
word
-
having been made known
to them
about
-
this child
*
and
all
the ones
having heard
were amazed
about
the things
having been spoken
by
the
shepherds
to
them
-
but
Mary
was keeping [in mind] all
*
-
these things
*
pondering [them]
in
the
heart
of her
and
returned
the
shepherds
glorifying
and
praising
-
God
for
all
which
they heard
and
saw
just as
was spoken
to
them
and
when
were completed
* days
* eight
for the ~ of
circumcising
him

of him
Jesus
the [name]
called
by
the
angel
before
-
he was conceived
*
in
the
womb
and
when
were completed
the
days
of the
purification
of them
according to
the
law
of Moses
they brought
him [up]
to
Jerusalem
to present [him]
to the
Lord
just as
it has been written
in
[the] law
of [the] Lord
-
every

in
Jerusalem
to whom [was the]

Simeon
and
-
this man [was]
*
righteous
and
devout
waiting for
[the] consolation

of Israel
and

was
[the] holy
upon

and
it had
to him
been revealed
by
the
spirit
-
holy [that he was]
not
to see
death
until
*
*
he might see
the
Christ
of [the] Lord
and
he came
by

spirit
into
the
temple
and
when

brought in
the

the
child
Jesus
-
[for] them to do
*
according to
the thing

God
and
said
now
you dismiss
the

the
Salvation
of you
which
you prepared
before
[the] face
of all
the
people
a light
for
revelation
[to the] Gentiles
and
glory
of your people
*
Israel
and
were
the
father
of him
and
the
mother
being amazed
at
the things
being spoken
about
him
and
blessed
them
Simon
and
said
to
Mary
the
mother
of him
behold
this one
is destined
for
[the] fall
and
rising
of many
in
-
Israel
and
for
a sign
being opposed
and
of you
also
yourself
the
soul
will pierce
a sword - so that
*
*
may be revealed
from
many
hearts
[the] thoughts
and
there was
Anna
a prophetess
a daughter
of Phanuel
from
[the] tribe
of Asher
this [woman]
having become advanced
in
many days

having lived
with
[her] husband

day
and
at that very hour
*
*
having stood nearby
she was praising
-
God
and
she was speaking
about
him
to all
the ones
anticipating
[the] redemption
of Jerusalem
and
when
completed
everything
-
according to
the
law
of [the] Lord
they returned
to
-
Galilee
to
[the] city
of them
Nazareth
and the
*
child
was growing
and
was being strengthened
being filled
with wisdom
and
[the] grace
of God
was
upon
it (him)
and
were traveling
the
parents
of him
every
year
to
Jerusalem
for the
feast
of the
Passover
*and
when
he became
of years
twelve
going up
[with] them
according to
the
custom
of the
feast
*and
having fulfilled
the
days
when
*
they returned
*
remained
Jesus
the
boy
in
Jerusalem
and
did not know
*
the
parents
of him
having supposed
and
him
to be
in
the
caravan
they went
a journey of a day
*
and
they were looking for
him
among
the
relatives
and
the
acquaintances
*and
not
having found [him]
they returned
to
Jerusalem
looking for
him
and
it came about
after
days
three 
they found
him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
[the] midst
of the
teachers
and
listening
to them
and
questioning
them
and were amazed
*
all
the ones
listening
to him
at
the
intelligence
and
the
answers
of him
and
having seen
him
they were astounded
and
*said
to
him
the
mother
of him
son
why
did you do
thus to us ?
*
behold
the
father
of you
and I
being anxious
were looking for
you
and
he said
to
them
why [is it]
that
you were looking for
me ?
not
had you ~ known
that
in
the things
of the
father
of me
it is necessary [for]
me to be ?
*
and
they
did not understand
*
they
word
which
he spoke
to them
and
he went down
with
them
and
they came
to
Nazareth
and
he was being subject
*
to them
and
the
mother
of him
was treasuring
all
the
matters
in
the
heart
of her
and
Jesus
was increasing
*in
*-
wisdom
and
stature
and
in favor
with
God
and
men
in
[the] year
now
fifteenth
of the
reign
of Tiberius
Caesar
[while] governing
Pontius
Pilate
-
of Judea
and
being tetrarch
-
of Galilee [was]
Herod
and Philip
*
the
brother
of him
being tetrarch
-
of Iturea
and
of Trachonitis
of [the] country
and
Lysanias
-
of Abilene
being tetrarch
at the time of
[the] high priest [hood]
of Annas
and
Caiaphas
came
[the] word
of God
to
John
the
son of Zechariah
*
in
the
wilderness
and
he came
to
all
the
surrounding region
of the
Jordan
preaching
a baptism
of repentance
for
[the] forgiveness
of sins
as
it has been written
in
[the] book
of [the] words
of Isaiah
the
prophet
a voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
prepare
the
way
of [the] Lord
make straight
*
the
paths
of him
every
valley
will be filled  in
and
every
mountain
and
hill
will be leveled off
and
will be
the
crooked [made]
into
straight
and
the
rough [paths made]
into
smooth roads
*
and
will see
all
flesh
the
salvation
-
of God
therefore he was saying
*
to the
crowds coming out
*
to be baptized
by
him
children
of vipers
who
warned
you
to flee
from
the
coming
wrath ?
therefore produce
*
fruits
worthy
-
of repentance
and
not 
do begin
to say
within
yourselves
we have father
*
-
Abraham
for I say
*
to you
that
is able
-
God
from
-
these stones
*
to raise up
children
-
to Abraham
and already
*
even
the
ax
to
the
root
of the
trees
is laid
therefore every
*
tree
not producing
*
good fruit
*
is cut down
and
into
[the] fire
is thrown
and
were questioning
him
the
crowds
saying
what
then
should we do ?
and having answered
*
he was saying
to them
the one
having
two
coats
let him share
with the one
not
having [one]
and
the one
having
food
let him do likewise
*
now came
*
also
tax collectors
to be baptized
and
they said
to
him
teacher
what
should we do ?
-
and
he said
to
them
nothing
more
than
the [amount]
having been commanded
you
collect
and were asking
*
him
also
soldiers
saying
what
should do
also
we ?
and
he said
to them
[from] no one
extort money
nor
slander
and
be satisfied
with the
wages
of you
and being expectant
*
the
people
and
wondering
everyone
in
the
hearts
of them
concerning
-
John
whether perhaps
he
might be
the
Christ
answered
saying
everyone
-
John
I
-
with water
baptize
you
is coming
but
the one
stronger
than me (I)
of whom
I am not
*
worthy
to untie
the
strap
of the
sandals
of him
he
will baptize you
*
with
[the] holy spirit
*
and
with fire
of whom
the
winnowing fork [is]
in
the
hand
of him
to clean out
the
threshing floor
of him
and
to gather
the
wheat
into
the
barn
of him
but the
*
chaff
he will burn up
with an inextinguishable fire
*
[with] many
-
therefore
and
other [words]
exhorting
he was preaching the good news
to the
people
-
now
Herod
the
tetrarch
being reproved
by
him
about
Herodias
the
wife
of the
brother
of him
and
about
all
which
did
[the] evil [things]
-
Herod
he added
this also
*
on top of
everything [else]
and
locked up
-
John
in
prison
and it came about
*
while
*
were baptized
all
the
people
also
Jesus
having been baptized
and
praying
to be opened
-
heaven
and
to descend
the
spirit
-
holy
in bodily
form
as
a dove
upon
him

forty days
*
being tempted
by
the
devil
and
he did not eat

anything
in
-
those days
*
and
having been completed
they (the days)
he hungered
and said
*
to him
the
devil
if
you are [the] son
*
-
of God
tell
-
this stone
*
that
it might become
a loaf [of bread]
and
answered
to
him
-
Jesus
it has been written
-
not
by
bread
alone
will live
-
man
and
having led up
him
he showed
to him
all
the
kingdoms
of the
world
in
a moment
of time
and
said
to him
the
devil
to you
I will give
-
authority
this
all
and
the
glory
of them
because
it has been given to me
*
and
to whomever
*
I desire
I give
it
you
therefore
if
bow down in worship
before
me
will be
yours
everything
and
having answered
-
Jesus
said
to him
it has been written
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
you shall worship
and
him
alone
you shall serve
and he led
*
him
to
Jerusalem
and
set [him]
upon
the
pinnacle
of the
temple
and
said
to him
if
you are [the] son
*
-
of God
throw
yourself
down from here
*
for it has been written
*
-
to the
angels
of him
he will give orders
concerning
you
-
to protect
you
and
-
upon [their]
hands
they will lift up
you
lest
you strike
against
a stone
the
foot
of you
and
having answered
said
to him
-
Jesus
-
it has been said
you shall not put to the test
*
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
and
having completed
every
temptation
the
devil
went away
from
him
until
[an opportune] time
and
returned
-
Jesus
in
the
power
of the
Spirit
to
-
Galilee
and
a report
went out
throughout
all
the
surrounding countryside
about
him
and
he
was teaching
in
the
synagogues
of them
being praised
by
all
and
he came
to
Nazareth
where
he had been 
brought up
and
he entered
according to
-
custom
his
on
the
day
of the
Sabbath
into
the
synagogue
and
stood up
to read
and
was given
to him
[the] book
of the
prophet
Isaiah
and
having unrolled
the
scroll
he found
the
place
where
it been 
had written
[the] spirit
of [the] Lord [is]
upon
me
of which
on account 
he anointed
me
to preach good news
to [the] poor
he has sent
me
to preach
to [the] captives
release
and
to [the] blind
[the] recovery of sight
to send forth
ones having been oppressed
in [to]
freedom
to preach
[the] year
of [the] Lord's
favor
and
having rolled up
the
scroll [and]
having given [it] back
to the
attendant
he sat down
and
of all
the
eyes
in
the
synagogue
were focused
*
on him
and he began
*
to speak
to
them
-
today
has been fulfilled
-
this scripture
*
in
the
ears
of you
and
everyone
was speaking well [of]
him
and
they were amazed
at
the
words
-
gracious
-
coming out
from
the
mouth
of him
and
they were saying
not
[the] son
is
of Joseph
this one ?
and
he said
to
them
no doubt
you will speak
to me
-
this parable
*
physician
heal
yourself
everything which
we heard
having happened
in
-
Capernaum
do
also
here
in
the
hometown
of you
but he said
*
truly
I say
to you
that
no
prophet
is welcome
*
in
the
hometown
of him
in
truth
and
I tell
you
many
widows
were
in
the
days
of Elijah
in
-
Israel
when
was shut up
-
heaven
for
three years
*
and
six months
*
when
occurred
a great famine
*
over
all
the
land
and
to
not one
of them
was sent
Elijah
except
*
to
Zarephath
-
of Sidon
to
a woman
a widow
and
many
lepers
were
in
-
Israel
during [the time of]
Elisha
the
prophet
and
not one
of them
was cleansed
except
*
Naaman
the
Syrian
and
all were filled
*
with anger
in
the
synagogue
hearing
these things
and
having arisen
they drove out
him
outside
the
city
and
they led
him
up to
[the] top
of the
hill
upon
which
the
city
of them had been built
*
in order
to throw down
him
he
but 
having gone
through
[the] midst
of them
was walking away
and
he went down
to
Capernaum
a city
-
of Galilee
and
he was teaching
*
them
on
the
Sabbaths
and
they were amazed
at
the
teaching
of him
because
with
authority
was
the
word
of him
and
in
the
synagogue
there was
a man
having
a spirit
of an demon
unclean 
and
he cried out
[with] a loud voice
*
ah
what [is this]
to us
and
to you
Jesus
of Nazareth?
did you come
to destroy
us ?
I know
who you
*
are
the
holy one
-
of God
and
rebuked
him
-
Jesus
saying
be silent
and
come out
from
him
and
having thrown [down]
him
the
demon
into
the
midst [of them]
he came out
from
him
without
having harmed
him
and
fear came
*
upon
everyone
and
they were talking
to
one another
saying
what [is]
-
this word
*
for
with
authority
and
power
he commands
the
unclean
spirits
and
they come out ?
and
a report was going out
*
about
him
into
every
place
of the
surrounding region
and having arisen
*
from
the
synagogue
he entered
into
the
house
of Simon
and [the] mother in law
*
-
of Simon
was suffering with
*
a high fever
*
and
they asked
him
about
her
and
having stood
over
her
he rebuked
the
fever
and
it left
her
and at once
*
having arisen
she was serving
them
and [while] setting
*
the
Sun
all
who
had
ailing ones
with various diseases
*
they brought
them
to
him
and he
*
[upon] each one
*
of them
the (his)
hands
laying
he was healing
them
and were coming out
*
also
demons
from
many
crying out
and
saying
-
you
are
the
son
-
of God
and
rebuking [them]
not
he was allowing
them
to speak
because
they had known
the
Christ
him
to be
and having come
*
day
having gone forth
he went out
to
a desolate
place
and
the
crowds
were seeking
him
and
they came
up to
him
and
they were hindering
him [so as]
-
not [to allow him]
to depart
from
them
-
but
he said
to
them
-
also
to the
other
cities
to preach
[for] me
it is necessary
the
kingdom
-
of God
because
for this purpose
*
I was sent
and
he was preaching
*
in
the
synagogues
-
* of Judea
it came about
now 
while
*
the
crowd
was pressing upon
him
and
listening
to the
word
-
of God
-
he
had been
standing
beside
the
lake
of Gennesaret
and
he saw
two
boats
having been
beside
the
lake
but the
*
fishermen
from
them
having gone away
were washing
the
nets
and embarking
*
into
one
of the
boats
which
was
Simon's
he asked
him
from
the
land
to put out
a little
and having sat down
*
from
the
boat
he was teaching
the
crowds
when
and
he stopped
speaking
he said
to
-
Simon
put out
into
the
deep [water]
and
let down
the
nets
of you
for
a catch
and
having answered
Simon
said
master
throughout
[the] whole
night
having labored
nothing
we caught
but on account of
*
the
word
of you
I will let down
the
nets
and
this
having done
they enclosed
multitude
of fish
a great
and were being torn
*
the
nets
of them
and
they signaled
for the
partners
in
the
other
boat [that]
-
having come
to help
them
and
they came
and
they filled
both
-
boats
so as
to be sinking
them
and having seen [this]
*
Simon
Peter
fell down at
the
knees
of Jesus
saying
depart
from
me
for
man
a sinful ~
I am
Lord
for astonishment
*
seized
him
and
all
the ones
with
him
on account of
the
catch
-
of fish
which
they took
and likewise
*
also
James
and
John
[the] sons
of Zebedee
who
were
partners
-
with Simon
and
said
to
-
Simon
-
Jesus
not 
do be afraid
from
-
now [on]
men
you will
catch
and
having  left behind
the
boats
on
the
land [and]
having left
everything
they followed
him
and
it came about
while
*
[was] to be
he 
in
one
of the
cities
and
behold
[there was] a man
full
of leprosy
and having seen
*
-
Jesus
having fallen
on
[his] face
he begged
him
saying
Lord
if
you are willing
you are able
to cleanse me
*
and
having stretched out
the (his)
hand
he touched
him
saying
I am willing
be cleansed
and
immediately
the
leprosy
departed
from
him
and
he
gave orders
to him
no one
to tell 
but
having departed
show
yourself
to the
priest
and
make an offering
for
the
cleansing
of you
as
Moses commanded
*
for
a testimony
to them
but he was spreading
*
[even] more
the
word
about
him
and
were assembling
many crowds
*
to listen
and
to be healed
from
the
sicknesses
of them
but he
*
was
withdrawing
in
the
wilderness places
and
was praying
and
it came about
on
one
of the
days
-
he
was
teaching
and
were
sitting down
Pharisees
and
teachers of the law
who
had come
*
from
every
village
-
of Galilee
and
Judea
and
Jerusalem
and
[the] power
of [the] Lord
was
in
-
to cure
him
and
behold
men
carrying
on
a pallet
a man
who
had been
paralyzed
and
were seeking
him
to carry in
and
to place
him
before
him
and
not
having found
by what way
they might carry
him
because of
the
crowd
having gone up
onto
the
roof
through
the
tiles
they let down
him
with
the
pallet
into
the
midst
in front of
-
Jesus
and
having seen
the
faith
of them
he said
man
having been forgiven
you
the
sins
of you
and
began
to reason
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
saying
who
is
this
who
is speaking
blasphemies ?
who
is able
sins
to forgive
except
*
alone
-
God ?
but having known
*
-
Jesus
the
thoughts
of them
having answered
he said
to
them
why
are you reasoning
in
the
hearts
of you ?
which
is
easier
to say
have been forgiven
you
the
sins
of you
or
to say
get up
and
walk ?
but in order that
*
you may know
that
the
son
-
of man
has authority
*
on
-
earth
to forgive
sins-he said
*
to the one
having been paralyzed
to you
I say
get up
and
having picked up
the
pallet
of you [and]
go
to
the
house
of you
and
at once
having arisen
in front of
them
having picked up [that]
upon
which
he was lying
he departed
to
the
house
of him
glorifying
-
God
and
terror
seized
everyone
and
they were glorifying
-
God
and
they were filled
with fear
saying
-
we saw
remarkable things
today
and
after
these things
he went out
and
saw
a tax collector
by name
Levi
sitting
in
the
tax office
and
he said
to him
follow
me
and
having left behind
everything [and]
having arisen
he was following
him
and
arranged
a great banquet
*
Levi
for him
in
the
house
of him
and
there was
great
a crowd
of tax collectors
and
others
who
were
with
them
reclining
and
were murmuring
the
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
of them
against
the
disciples
of him
saying
why
*
with
the
tax collectors
and
sinners
are you eating
and
drinking ?
and
having answered
-
Jesus
said
to
them
no
need
have
the ones
being healthy
of a physician
but
the ones
having illness
*
I have not come
*
to call
[the] righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
-
but
they said
to
him
the
disciples
of John
fast
often
and
offer prayers
*
likewise
also
the ones
of the
Pharisees
but the ones
*
to you
eat
and
drink
-
but
Jesus
said
to
them
you are not able
*
the
sons
of the
wedding attendants
while
*
the
bridegroom
with
them
is
to make
to fast [are you] ?
but will come
*
days
also
when
is taken away
from
them
the
bridegroom
then
they will fast
in
those
-
days
now he was telling
*
also
a parable
to
them
-
no one
a patch
from
a new garment
*
having torn
puts [it]
on
an old garment
*
otherwise
*
*
*
both
the
new
will tear
and
with the
old
will not match
*
the
patch
-
from
the
new
and
no one
puts
new wine
*
into
old wineskins
*
otherwise
*
*
*
will burst
the
wine
-
new
the
wineskins
and
it
will be spilled
and
the
wineskins
will be destroyed
rather
wine
new ~
into
wineskins
new
must be put
and
no one 
having drunk
[the] old
desires
[the] new
he says
for 
the
old
good [enough]
is ~
it came about
and
on
[the] Sabbath
[that] he is passing
*
through
grain fields
and
were plucking
the
disciples
of him
and
eating
the
heads [of grain and]
rubbing [them]
in the (their)
hands
now some
*
of the
Pharisees
said
why
are you doing
what
is not permissible
*
on the
Sabbaths?
and
having answered
to
them
said
-
Jesus
not
this
have you read
what
did
David
when
was hungry
he 
and
the ones
with
him
being [hungry]
how
he entered
into
the
house
-
of God
and
the
loaves
of the
presentation
having taken
he ate
and
gave
to the ones
with
him
which
not
is permissible
to eat
except
*
only
the
priests ?
and
he was saying
to them
Lord
is
of the
Sabbath
the
son
-
of man
and it came about
*
on
another
Sabbath
[that] he entered
*
into
the
synagogue
and
taught
and
there was
a man
there
also
the
hand
of him
the
right [one]
was
withered
now were watching
*
him
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
if
on
the
Sabbath
he heals
in order that
they might find [something]
to accuse
him
but he
*
knew
the
thoughts
of them
and said
*
to the
man
-
withered
having
the
hand
rise
and
stand
in
the
midst
and
having arisen
he stood
and said
*
-
Jesus
to
them
I ask
you
whether
it is permissible
on the
Sabbath
to do good
or
to do evil
life
to save
or
to destroy
and
having looked around [at]
all
of them
he said
*to him
stretch out
the
hand
of you
-
and
he did
and
was restored
the
hand
of him
but they
*
were filled
with fury
and
they were discussing
with
one another
what
they
might do
-
to Jesus
now it came about
*
in
-
these days
*
[that] he went forth
*
to
the
mountain
to pray
and
he was
*spending the whole night
in
-
prayer
-
to God
and
when
day came
*
he summoned
the
disciples
of him
and
having chosen
from
them
twelve
whom
also
he named apostles
*
Simon
who
also
he called
Peter
and
Andrew
the
brother
of him
and
James
and
John
and
Philip
and
Bartholomew
and
Matthew
and
Thomos
and
James
[the son of] Alphaeus
and
Simon
the one
being called
A Zealot
and
Judas
[the son of] James
and
Judas
Iscariot
who
became
a traitor
and
having come down
with
them
he stood
on
a level place
*
and
a great crowd
*
of disciples
of him
and
a great multitude
*
of the
people
from
all
-
Judea
and
Jerusalem
and
the
coastal region
of Tyre
and
Sidon
who
came
to hear
him
and
to be healed
from
the
diseases
of them
and
the ones
being troubled
by
unclean spirits
*
were being healed
and
all
the
crowd
were seeking
to touch
him
because
power
from
him
was going out
and
he was healing
everyone
and
he
having lifted up
the
eyes
of him
to
the
disciples
of him
was saying
blessed [are]
the
poor
for
yours
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
blessed [are]
the ones
hungering
now
for
you will eat your fill
blessed [are]
the ones
weeping
now
for
you will laugh
blessed
are you
when
hate
you
-
men
and
when
they ostracize
you
and
they reproach [you]
and
cast out
the
name
of you
as
evil
because
of the
son
-
of man
rejoice
in
that
-
day
and
leap for joy
behold
for 
the
reward
of you [is]
great
in
-
heaven
according to
the
same things
for
were doing
to the
prophets
the
father
of them
but
woe
to you
the
rich ones
for
you are receiving in full
the
comfort
of you
woe
to you
the ones
having been well fed
now
for
you will hunger
woe
the ones
laughing
now
for
you will mourn
and
weep
woe
when
of you
well
speak
all
-
men
according
*to the
same things
for
were doing
to the
false prophets
the
fathers
of them
but
to you
I say
to the ones
listening
love
the
enemies
of you
do good
*
to the ones
hating
you
bless
the ones
cursing
you
pray
for
the ones
mistreating
you
to the one
hitting
you
on
the
cheek
offer
also
the
other
and
from
the one
taking away
your
-
coat
also
the
shirt
not
do withhold
to everyone
asking
you
give
and
from
the one
taking away
things
your 
not 
do demand [them] back
and
just as
you want
that
may do
to you
-
men
do
to them
similarly
and
if
you love
the ones
loving
you
what kind of
to you
credit
it [that] ?
for even
*
the
sinners
the ones
loving
them
love
for even
*
if
you do good
to the ones
doing good
to you
what kind of
to you
credit
is [that] ?
even
-
sinners
the
same
do
and
if
you lend
from
whom
you hope
to receive
what kind of
to you
credit
of [that] ?
even
sinners
to sinners
lend
that
they may receive in return
the same amount
the same amount
but
love
the
enemies
of you
and
do good
and
loan
nothing
expecting in return
and
will be
the
reward
of you
great
and
you will be
sons
of [the] most high
because
he
is kind
*
to
the
ungrateful
and
evil [ones]
be
compassionate
just as
also
the
father
of you
is compassionate
*
and
not 
do judge
and
by no means
*
may you be judged
and
not
do condemn
and
by no means
*
may you be condemned
forgive
and
you will be forgiven
give
and
it will be given
to you
measure
a good 
having been pressed down [and]
having been shaken
over flowing
will be put
into
the
lap
of you
for by what
*
measure
you measure
it will be measured in return
to you
now he told
*
also
a parable
to them

a blind person is [not] able
*
to lead a blind person ?
*
[will] not
both
into
a pit
fall in ?
not
is
a pupil
above
the
teacher
but having been fully trained
*
everyone
will be
like
the
teacher
of him
and why
*
do you see
the
speck
-
in
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
but the
*
log
-
in
your own
*
eye
you do not notice?
*
how
are you able
to say
to the
brother
of you
brother
let me [that]
I may remove
the
speck
-
in
the
eye
of you
[while] yourself
-
in
the
eye
of you
[the] log
not
seeing?
hypocrite
remove
first
the
log
from
the
eye
of you
and
them
you will see clearly
the
speck
-
in
the
eye
of the
brother
of you
to take out
no

there is
tree

producing
fruit
*bad
nor
again
tree
*a bad
producing

the

for from
*
[the] abundance
of [the] heart

the
mouth
of him
and why

do you call me
*
Lord
Lord
and [yet]
you
do not do
what
I say ?
everyone
-
coming
to
me
and
hearing
my
-
words
and
doing
them
I will show
you
to whom
he is
likened
he is likened
*
to [the] man
building
a house
who
dug
and
went down deep
and
laid
a foundation
upon
the
rock
and a flood
*
having come
struck against
the
river
-
that house
*
and
it was not strong [enough]
*
to shake
it
because
-
well
it to have been built
*
now the one
*
having heard
and
not having done
*
is like
*
a man
having built
a house
upon
the
ground
without
a foundation
which
struck against
the
river
and
immediately
it collapsed
and
was
the
ruin
-
of that house
*
great
when
he finished
all
the
words
of him
in
the
ears
of the
people
he entered
into
Capernaum
of a centurion
now
a certain
slave
having an illness
*
was about
to die
who
was
by him
highly regarded
and having heard
*
about
-
Jesus
he sent
to
him
elders
of the
Jews
asking
him
that
having come
he might cure
the
slave
of him
and the ones
*
having come
to
-
Jesus
were begging
him
earnestly
saying
-
he is worthy
*
for whom
you will grant
this
for he loves
*
the
nation
of us
and
the
synagogue
he
built
for us
-
and
Jesus
was going
with
them
by this time
now 
he
not
far
being
from
the
house
sent
friends
the
centurion
saying
to him
Lord
do not trouble [yourself]
*
for not
*
worthy
am I
that
under
the
roof
of me
you should enter
therefore
not
myself
I considered worthy
to
you
to come
but
say
[the] word
and
let me healed
the
servant
of me
also
*for
I
am a man
*
under
authority
being placed
having
under
myself
soldiers
and
I say
to this one
go
and
he goes
and
to another
come
and
he comes
and
to the
slave
of me
do
this
and
he does [it]
and having heard
*
these things
-
Jesus
was amazed [at]
him
and
having turned
to the
following
him
crowd
he said
I say
to you
not
in
-
Israel
such great
faith
have I found
and
having returned
to
the
house
the ones
having been sent
found
the
slave
being good health
and
it came about
on
the
next day [that]
he proceeded
to
a city
being called
Nain
and
were traveling along
with him
the
disciples
of him
and
a great crowd
*
as
now 
he approached
the
gate
of the
city
-
behold
was being carried out
having died
[the] only
son
to the
mother
of him
and
she
was
a widow
and
crowd
of the
city
a considerable
was
with
her
and
having seen
her
the
Lord
had compassion
upon
her
and
said
to her
not 
do cry
and
having approached
he touched
the
coffin
and the ones
*
carrying [the coffin]
stood [still]
and
he said
young man
to you
I say
get up
and
sat up
the
dead man
and
he began
to speak
and
he gave
him
to the
mother
of him
seized
and
fear
everyone
and
they were glorifying
-
God
saying
-
a great prophet
*
was raised up
among
us
and
-
visited
-
God
the
people
of him
and
went out
-
this report
*
in
all
-
Judea
about
him
and
in all
the
surrounding country side
and
reported
to John
the
disciples
of him
about
all
these things
and
having summoned
a certain two
*
of the
disciples
of him
-
John
sent
to
the
Lord
saying
you
are 
the one
coming
or
for another
should we be looking ?
and having come
*
to
him
the
men
said
John
the
baptist
sent
us
to
you
saying
you
are 
the one
coming
or
for another
should we be looking ?
in
that
-
hour
he healed
many
of
diseases
and
afflictions
and
spirits
evil 
and
to many blind [persons]
*
he granted
to see
and
having answered
he said
to them
having gone
report
to John
what
you saw
and
heard
blind [persons]
receive sight
lame [persons]
walk
lepers
are cleansed
and
deaf [persons]
hear
dead [persons]
are raised
poor people
have the good news preached [to them].
and
blessed
is
* whoever
*
 not
does take offense
at
me
and [as] were departing
*
the
messengers
of John
he began
to say
to
the
crowds
about
John
what
did you go out
into
the
wilderness
to see ?
a reed
by
[the] wind
being shaken ?
but
what
did you go out
to see ?
a man
in
soft
clothing
having been dressed ?
behold
the ones
with
glorious apparel
*
and
living in luxury
*
in
the
palaces
are
but
what
did you go out
to see?
a prophet ?
yes
I say
to you
and
more
[than] a prophet
this one
is he
about
whom
it has been written
behold
I send
the
messenger
of me
before
your face
*
who
will prepare
the
way
of you
in front of
you
I say
to you
greater [than]
among
[those] born
of women
John
no one
is
but the one
*
of least importance
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
greater [than]
him
is
and
all
the
people
having listened
and
the
tax collectors
justified
-
God
having been baptized [with]
the
baptism
of John
but the
*
Pharisees
and
the
teachers of the law
the
purpose
-
of God
they set aside
for
themselves
not having been baptized
*
by
him
therefore to what
*
will I compare
the
men
-
of this generation
*
and
to what
are they
like?
they are like
*
children
-
in
[the] market place
sitting
and
calling out
to one another
who
says
we played the flute
for you
and
you did not dance
*
we sang a dirge
and
you did not weep
*
for has come
*
John
the
baptist
not eating
*
bread
nor
drinking
wine
and
you say
he has a demon
*
has come
the
son
-
of man
eating
and
drinking
and
you say
behold
a man [who is]
a glutton
and
a drunkard
a friend
of tax collectors
and
sinners
and
was (is) justified
-
wisdom
by
all
of the
children
of her
was asking
now
a certain one
him
of the
Pharisees
that
he might eat
with
him
and
having entered
into
the
house
of the
Pharisee
he reclined at table
and
behold
a woman
who
was
in
the
city
a sinner
and
having known
that
he reclines at table
in
the
house
of the
Pharisee
having brought
an alabaster [jar]
of perfume
and
having stood
behind
at
the
feet
of him
crying
with the
tears
she began
to wet
the
feet
of him
and
with the
hairs
of the
head
of her
she was wiping
and
was kissing
the
feet
of him
and
was anointing [them]
with the
perfume
but having seen [this]
*
the
Pharisee
-
having invited
him
spoke
within
himself
saying
if this one
*
was
a prophet
he would have known
*
who
and
what sort of
-
woman
who
is touching
him
because
she is a sinner
*
and having answered
*
-
Jesus
said
to
him
Simon
I have
to you
something
to say
he
and
teacher
speak
he says
two [persons]
were debtors
*
to a certain creditor
*
the
one
was owing
five hundred denarii
*
and the
*
other
fifty
not having
*
of themselves
to pay
he forgave both
*
therefore which
*
of them
more
will love
him ?
having answered
Simon
said
I suppose
-
to whom
the
more
he forgave
-
and
he said
to him
correctly
*you judged
and
having turned
to
the
woman
-
he said to Simon
*
do you see
this
-
woman ?
I entered
into your
*
-
house
water
for me
on [my]
feet
you did not give
*
but she
*
with the (her)
tears
wet
my
-
feet
and
with the
hairs
of her
wiped [them]
a kiss
to me
you did not give
*
but she
*
from
[the time] which
I entered
did not stop
*
kissing
my
-
feet
with oil
the
head
of me
you did not anoint
*
but she
*
with perfume
anointed
the
feet
of me
for this reason
*
I say
to you
have been forgiven
the
sins
of her [which are]
-
many
for
she loved
much
but to whom
*
little
is forgiven
little
he loves
and he said
*
to her
have been forgiven
your
-
sins
and
began
the ones
reclining with [him]
to say
among
themselves
who
is this
*
who
even
*forgives sins ?
*forgives sins ?
and he said
*
to
the
woman
the
faith
of you
has saved
you
go
in
peace
and
it came about
soon afterwards
*
*
-
he
was traveling through
every
city
and
village
preaching
and
proclaiming  the good news [of]
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
the
twelve [were]
with
him
and
women
some ~
who
had been 
healed
from
spirits
evil 
and
diseases
Mary
the one
being called
Magdalene
from
whom
demons
seven 
had gone out
and
Joanna
[the] wife
of Chuza
[the] steward
of Herod
and
Susanna
and
others
many
who
were proving
for them
from
the
possessions belonging
to them
now [when] gathering
*
a large crowd
*
and
the ones
in every
city
making their way
to
him
he spoke
by means
of a parable
went out
the one
sowing
-
to sow
the
seed
of him
and
while
*
he sows
*
-
some
fell
beside
the
road
and
it was trampled upon
and
the
birds
-
of heaven
devoured
it
and
other(s)
fell down
upon
the
rock
and
having grown up
it dried up
because
-
it has no
*
moisture
and
other(s)
fell
in
[the] midst
-
of thorns
and
having grown up with [it]
the
thorns
choked
it
and
other(s)
fell
in
the
soil
-
good
and
having grown up
it produced
fruit
a hundred fold
saying these things
*
he was calling out
the one
having
ears
to hear
let that one hear
now were questioning
*
him
the
disciples
of him
what
this
might be
-
parable
-
and
he said
to you
it has been granted
to know
the
mysteries
of the
kingdom
-
of God
but to the
*
others [ I speak]
in
parables
in order that
seeing
not
they may see
and
hearing
not
they may understand
is [the meaning of]
now
this
the
parable
the
seed
is
the
word
-
of God
now the ones
*
beside
the
road
are
the ones
having heard
then
comes
the
devil
and
takes away
the
word
from
the
heart
of them
lest
*
having believed
they may be saved
the ones
now
upon
the
rock
who
when
they hear
with
joy
they receive
the
word
and
these
a root
not
do have
who
for
a while
believe
and
in
a time
of testing
they fall away
now the one
*
in
the
thorns
having fallen
these
are
the ones
having heard
and
by
[the] anxieties
and
riches
and
pleasures
-
of life
[while] going along
they are choked
and
not
do bring fruit to maturity
now the one
*
in
the
Good
soil
these
are [those]
who
with
heart
an honest
and
good
having heard
the
word
retain
and
bear fruit
with
patience
and no one
*
having lit a lamp
*
covers
it
with a jar
or
under
a bed
places [it]
but
on
a lampstand
places [it]
in order that
the ones
entering
may see
the
light
for not [anything ]
*
is
hidden
which
not
evident
will become
nor [anything]
secret
which
by no means may be made known
*
*
and
to
light
come
therefore be careful
*
how
you listen
for whoever
*
*
has
it will be given
to him
and
whoever
*
does not have
*
even
what
he seems
to have
will be taken
from
him
and came
*
to
him
the
mother
and
the
brothers
of him
and
they were not able
*
to join
him
because of
the
crowd
it was announced
and 
to him
the
mother
of you
and
the
brothers
of you
have been standing
outside
to see
wanting 
you
-
but
having answered
he said
to
them
[the] mother
of me
and
brothers
of me
are these
*
the ones
the
word
-
of God
hearing
and
doing
now it came about
*
on
one
of the
days [that]
-
he
embarked
into
a boat
and
the
disciples
of him
and
he said
to
them
let us go over
to
the
other side
of the
lake
and
they set out
sailing
and [while]
they
he fell asleep
and
came down
a storm
of wind
to
the
lake
and
they were being swamped
and
were in danger
and having approached
*
they woke
him
saying
master
master
we are  perishing
-
and
having been awakened
he rebuked
the
wind
and
the
roughness
of the
water
and
they ceased
and
it became
calm
and he said
*
to them
where [is]
the
faith
of you ?
and being afraid
*
they were amazed
saying
to
one another
who
then
is this
*
that
even
the
winds
he commands
and
the
water
and
they obey
him ?
and
they sailed down
to
the
country
of the
Gerasenes
which
is
opposite
-
Galilee
and having gone out
*
him
upon
the
land
met [him]
a certain man
*
from
the
city
having
demons
and
for a time
considerable
not
was dressed [in]
clothing
and
in
a house
he was not living
*
but
among
the
tombs
having seen
and
-
Jesus
[and] having cried out
he fell down before
him
and
in a loud voice
*
said
what
to me
and
to you
Jesus
son
-
of God
-
most high ?
I beg
you
not
me
do torment
for he gave orders
*
to the
spirit
-
unclean
to come out
from
the
man
for many
*
times
it had seized
him
and
having been bound
with chains
and
shackles
being guarded
and
breaking apart
the
bounds
he was being driven
by
the
demon
into
the
wilderness places
and questioned
*
him
-
Jesus
what
to you
a name
is ?
-
and
he said
Legion
because
entered
many demons
*
into
him
and
they were begging
him
that
not
he might command
them
into
the
abyss
to depart
now there was
*
there
a herd
of many pigs
*
feeding
on
the
mountain
and
they begged
him
that
he might permit
them
into
those
to enter
and
he permitted
them
and having come out
*
the
demons
from
the
man
they entered
into
the
pigs
and
rushed
the
herd
down
the
bank
into
the
lake
and
were drowned
and having seen
*
the ones
feeding
the thing
having happened
they fled
and
reported
to
the
city
and
to
the
farms
and they went out
*
to see
the thing
having happened
and
came
to
-
Jesus
and
found
sitting
the
man
from
whom
the
demons
departed
having been dressed
and
being of sound mind
at
the
feet
-
of Jesus
and
they were afraid
and reported
*
to them
the ones
having seen
how
was healed
the one
having been demon possessed
and
asked
him
all
the
multitude
of the
surrounding country
of the
Gerasenes
to depart
from
them
because
with great fear
*
they were being seized
so he
*
having embarked
into
a boat [and]
returned
and was begging
*
him
the
man
from
whom
had gone out
the
demons
to be
with
him
but he sent away
*
him
saying
return
to
the
house
of you
and
tell
what
for you
did
-
God
and
he went away
throughout
the whole
*
city
preaching
what
did
for him
-
Jesus
now when
*
*
returns
-
Jesus
welcomed
him
the
crowd
for they were
*
all
expecting
him
and
behold
there came
a man
to whom [was given]
[the] name
Jairus
and
this one
ruler
of the
synagogue
was
and
having fallen
at
the
feet
-
of Jesus
he was pleading [with]
him
to enter
into
the
house
of him
because
an only daughter
*
was
to him
about
of years
twelve
and
she
was dying
now when
*
*
he goes
*
the
crowds
were pressing around
him
and
a woman
being
with
a flow
of blood
for
twelve years
*
who
( to Physicians
having spent
all
the (her)
property)
not
was able
from
anyone
to be healed
having approached
from behind
she touched
the
hem
of the
garment
of him
and
immediately
came to an end
the
flow
of the
blood
of her
and
said
-
Jesus
who [is]
the one
having touched
me ?
and denying [it]
*
everyone
said
-
Peter
Master
the
crowds
surround
you
and
are pressing against [you]
-
but
Jesus
said
touched
me
someone
for I
*
knew
power
having gone out
from
me
having seen
and
the
women
that
not
she did escape notice
trembling
came 
and
having fallen down before
him
for
what
reason
she touched
him
she proclaimed
before
all
the
people
and
how
she was healed
immediately
-
and
he said
to her
daughter
the
faith
of you
has saved
you
go
in
peace
[while] still
he
speaking
comes
someone
from
the
synagogue ruler
saying
-
has died
the
daughter
of you
no longer
trouble
the
teacher
-
but
Jesus
having heard
answered
him
do not be afraid
*
only
believe
and
she will be healed
and having come
*
into
the
house
he did not permit
*
anyone to enter
*
with
him
except
*
Peter
and
John
and
James
and
the
father
of the
child
and
the
mother
were crying
and 
all
and
were mourning [for]
her
-
but
he said
not 
do cry
for she did not die
*
*
but
is sleeping
and
they were ridiculing
him
having known
that
she died
but he
*
having taken
the
hand
of her
called out
saying
-
child
get up
and
returned
the
spirit
of her
and
she got up
immediately
and
he gave orders
to be given to her [something]
*
to eat
and
were amazed
the
parents
of her
-
but
he instructed
them
no one
to tell 
the thing
having happened
and having called together
*
the
twelve
he gave
to them
power
and
authority
over
all
the
demons
and
to heal diseases
*
and
he sent out
them
to preach
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
to heal
the
sick
and
he said
to
them
nothing
take 
for
the
journey
neither
walking stick
nor
beggars bag
nor
bread
nor
silver
nor
each
two
shirts
to have
and
into
whatever
*
house
you may enter
remain there
*
and
from there
go out
and
as many as
*
not
do receive
you
going out
from
-
city
that 
the
dust
from
the
feet
of you
shake off
for
a testimony
against
them
and going out
*
they were going around
throughout
the
villages
preaching the good news
and
healing
everywhere
now heard
*
Herod
the
tetrarch
the things
happening
all
and
he was perplexed
because
-
it was said
by
some
that
John
was raised
from
[the] dead
by
some
also
that
Elijah
had appeared
but others
*
that
some prophet
*
of the
ancients
arose
but said
*
Herod
John
I
beheaded
who
then
is
this
about
whom
I hear
such things ?
and
he was seeking
to see
him
and
having returned
the
apostles
told
him
what things
they did
and
having taken
them
he withdrew
privately
*
to
a city
being called
Bethsaida
but the
*
crowds
having realized [this]
followed
him
and
having welcomed
them
he was speaking
to them
about
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
the ones
having need
*
of healing
he was healing
now the
*
day
began
to decline
and having approached
*
the
twelve
said
to him
send away
the
crowd
so that
having gone
into
the
surrounding
villages
and
farms
they may find lodging
and
may find
provisions
for
here
in
a desolate
place
we are
and he said
*
to
them
give
to them
yourselves [something]
to eat
-
but
they said
there are not
*
to us
more
than
five loaves
*
and
two fish
*
unless
*
having gone
we
may buy
for
all
the
people
this
food
for there were
*
about
five thousand men
*
but said
*
to
the
disciples
of him
make lie down
them [in]
groups
about
fifty each
*
and
they did
so
and
all reclined
*
and having taken
*
the
five
loaves
and
the
two
fish [and]
having looked up
to
-
heaven
he blessed
them
and
broke [them]
and
was giving [them]
to the
disciples
to set before
the
crowd
and
they ate
and
all were satisfied
*
and
was picked up
the things
having been left over
by them
of fragments
baskets
twelve
and
it came about
while
*
he is
*
praying
*
*alone
were with
him
the
disciples
and
he questioned
them
saying
whom
me
declare
[do] the
crowds
to be ?
-
and
having answered
they said
John
the
Baptist
but others
*
Elijah
and others
*
that
a certain prophet
*
of the
ancients
rose again
and he said
*
to them
and you
*
whom
do you declare me
*
to be ?
and Peter
*
having answered
said
the
Christ
-
of God
-
and
having warned
them
he gave orders
no one
to tell 
this
having said
-
it is necessary for
the
son
-
of man
to suffer much
*
and
to be rejected
by
the
elders
and
chief priests
and
scribes
and
to be killed
and
on the
third
day
to be raised
and he was saying
*
to
all
if
anyone
wishes
after
me
to come
let him deny
himself
and
lift up
the
cross
of him
daily
*
and
let him follow
me
whoever
for
*
wishes
the
life
of him
to save
will lose
it
but whoever
*
*
loses
the
life
of him
on account of
me
this one
will save
it
for what
*
profits
a man
having gained
the
whole world
*
but himself
*
having lost
or
having forfeit ?
for whoever
*
*
is ashamed
of me
and
-
my
words
this one
the
son
-
of man
will be ashamed of
when
he comes
in
the
glory
of him
and
of the
father
and
of the
holy
angels
but I say
*
to you
truly
there are
some
of the ones
here
having stood
who
by no means
*
will taste
death
until
*
they see
the
kingdom
-
of God
it came about
and 
after
-
these words
*
about
eight days
*
and
having taken
Peter
and
John
and
James
he went up
to
the
mountain
to pray
and
it came about [that]
while
*
prays
he
the
appearance
of the
face
of him [became]
different
and
the
clothing
of him [became]
white
dazzling
and
behold
men
two 
were conversing
with him
who
were
Moses
and
Elijah
who
having appeared
in
glory
were speaking of
the
Exodus
of him
which
he was about
*to fulfill
in
Jerusalem
-
but
Peter
and
the ones
with
him
had been
weighed down
with sleep
and having awakened fully
*
they saw
the
glory
of him
and
the
two
men
the ones
having  stood
with him
and
it came about [that]
while
*
they parted
*
from
him
said
-
Peter
to
-
Jesus
Master
good
it is 
for us
here
to be 
-
let us make
three tents
*
one
for you
and
one
for Moses
and
one
for Elijah
not
having known
what
he says
and [while] these things
*
him
saying
came
a cloud
and
was overshadowing
them
and they were afraid
*
while
*
they entered
*
into
the
cloud
and
a voice
came
from
the
cloud
saying
this
is
the
son
of me
the one
having been chosen
listen to him
*
and
when
*
became [silent]
the
voice
was found
Jesus
alone
and
they
were silent
and
to no one
reported
in
those
-
days
anything
of what
they have seen
and it came about
*
on the
following
day
having come down
them
from
the
mountain
met
him
a large crowd
*
and
behold
a man
from
the
crowd
cried out
saying
teacher
I beg
you
to look
at
the
son
of me
for
an only child
to me
he is
and
behold
a spirit
seizes
him
and
suddenly
cries out
and
throws into a convulsion
him
with
foam [at the mouth]
and
hardly
departs
from
him [and]
it mauls
him
and
I begged
the
disciples
of you
that
they might cast out
it
and
they were not able
*
and having answered
*
-
Jesus
said
o
unbelieving generation
*
and
having been depraved
until
when
will be
with
you
and
will I put up with
you ?
bring
here
the
son
of you
still
now 
approaching
him
threw down
him
the
demon
and
convulsed [him]
rebuked
and
-
Jesus
the
spirit
-
unclean
and
healed
the
child
and
he returned
him
to the
father
of him
and were amazed
*
all
at
the
greatness
-
of God
and [while] all
*
marveling
at
everything
which
he was doing
he said
to
the
disciples
of him
establish
you
in
the
ears
of you
-
these words
*
for the
*
son
-
of man
is about to be delivered
*
into
[the] hands
of men
-
but
they were not understanding
-
this word
*
and
it had been hidden
*
from
them
in order that
not
they might understand
it
and
they were afraid
to ask
him
about
-
this word
*
now arose
*
an argument
among
them
-
who
might be
*
[the] greatest
of them
-
and
Jesus
having perceived
the
thought
of the
heart
of them
having taken
a child
stood
it (him)
beside
himself
and
he said
to them
whoever
*
receives
this
-
child
in
the
name
of me
receives me
*
and
whoever
whoever
receives me
*
receives
the one
having sent
me
for the
*
lesser
among
all
of you
being
this one
is
great
and having answered
*
John
said
Master
we saw
someone
in
the
name
of you
casting out
demons
and
we were trying to stop
him
because
he is not following
*
with
us
but said
*
to
him
-
Jesus
not 
do stop [him]
for who[ever]
*
not
is 
against
you
for
you
is
and it came about
*
while
*
approaches
the
day
of the
ascension
of him
and
he
the (his)
face
he resolutely set
-
to go
to
Jerusalem
and
he sent
messengers
before
[the] face
of him
and
having gone
they entered
into
a village
of Samaritans
in order
to make arrangements
for him
and
they did not receive
*
him
because
the
face
of him
was going
*
to
Jerusalem
and having seen
*
the
disciples
James
and
John
said
Lord
do you want [that]
we should call
fire
to come down
from
-
heaven
-
to consume
them?
and having turned
*
he rebuked
them
and
they went
to
another
village
and
[as] they were going
*
on
the
road
said
a certain one
to
him
I will follow
you
wherever
*
you go
and
said
to him
-
Jesus
the
foxes
dens
have
and
the
birds
of the
heaven
nests
but the
*
son
-
of man
does not have [a place]
*
where
the (his)
head
he may lay down
and he said
*
to
another
follow
me
-
but
he said
Lord
allow
me
having gone
first
to bury
the
father
of me
but he said
*
to him
leave
the
dead ones
to bury
-
their
dead ones
but you
*
having gone
proclaim
the
kingdom
-
of God
and said
*
also
another
I will follow
you
Lord
but first
*
allow
me
to say good - bye
to the ones
in
the
house
of me
but said
*
to
him
-
Jesus
no one
having put
the (his)
hand
upon
[the] plow
and
looking
to
the things
behind
is fit
*
for the
kingdom
-
of God
after
and 
these things
appointed
the
Lord
others
seventy two
*
and
he sent
them
two by two
*
*
before
[the] face
of him
into
every
city
and
place
where
he was about
*
to come
and he was saying
*
to
them
the
indeed
harvest [is]
plentiful
the
but
workers
few
therefore ask
*
the
Lord
of the
harvest
that
workers
he might send out
into
the
harvest
of him
go
behold
I send
you
as
lambs
in
[the] midst
of wolves
not 
do carry
a purse
nor
a beggar's bag
nor
sandals
and
no one
along
the
way
greet
into
what
and
ever
you enter
house
first
say
peace
-
to this house
*
and
if
there
there is
a son
of peace
will rest
upon
him
the
peace
of you
otherwise
*
*
*
on
you
it will return
in
same
and
the
house
remain
eating
and
drinking
the things
from
them
worthy [is]
for 
the
worker
of the
wage
of him
~ not ~
do ~ move
from
house
to
house
and
into
whichever
*
city
you enter
and
they receive
you
eat
the things
being set before
you
and
heal
the ones
in
it [who are]
sick
and
say
to them
has come near
to
you
the
kingdom
-
of  God
into
what
and
ever
city
you enter
and
~ not ~
they do ~ receive
you
having gone out
into
the
streets
of it
say
even
the
dust
-
having clung
to us
from
the
city
of you
to
the (our)
feet
we shake off [against]
you
but
know this
*
that
has come near
the
kingdom
-
of God
I say
to you
that
for Sodom
in
-
that day
*
more bearable
it will be
than
-
with city
that
woe
to you
Chorazin
woe
to you
Bethsaida
because
if
in
Tyre
and
Sidon
had occurred
the
miracles
-
having happened
in
you
long ago
[would have]
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
sitting
they repented
but
for Tyre
and
Sidon
it will be more bearable
*
in
the
judgment
than
for you
and
you
Capernaum
surely not
up to
heaven
will you be exalted ?
to
-
hades
you will come down
the one
listening
to you
to me
listens
and
the one
rejecting
you
me
rejects
but the one
*
me
rejecting
rejects
the one
having sent
me
and returned
*
the
seventy two
*
with
joy
saying
Lord
even
the
demons
submit
to us
in
the
name
of you
and he said
*
to them
I was seeing
-
Satan
like
lightning
from
-
heaven
having fallen
behold
I have given
to you
the
authority
-
to walk
on
snakes
and
scorpions
and
on
all
the
power
of the
enemy
and
nothing
you
by any means 
*
may injure
but
in
this
do not rejoice
*
because
the
spirits
submit to you
*
but rejoice
*
that
the
names of
you
have been recorded
in
the
heavens
in
the same
*
hour
he was full of joy
by
the
spirit
-
holy
and
he said
I praise
you
Father
Lord
-
of heaven
and
-
earth
that
you concealed
these things
from
[the] wise
and
intelligent
and
you revealed
them
to young children
yes
-
Father
for
thus
well pleasing
it was 
before
you
everything
was handed over to me
*
by
the
father
of me
and
no one
knows
who
is
the
son
except
*
the
father
and
who
is
the
father
except
*
the
son
and
to whomever
*
wishes
the
son
to reveal [him]
and
having turned
to
the
disciples
privately
*
he said
blessed [are]
the
eyes
-
seeing
what
you see
for I say
*
to you
that
many
prophets
and
kings
wanted
to see
what
you
see
and
not
they did ~ see [them]
and
to hear
what
you hear
and
not
they did ~ hear [them]
and
behold
lawyer
a certain
stood up
testing
him
saying
teacher
what
having done
life
eternal
will I inherit ?
-
and
he said
to
him
in
the
law
what
has been written?
how
do you read [it] ?
-
and
having answered
he said
you will love
[the] Lord
the
God
of you
from
all
the
heart
of you
and
with
all
the
soul
of you
and
with
all
the
strength
of you
and
with
all
the
mind
of you
and
the
neighbor
of you
as
yourself
and he said
*
to him
you have answered correctly
*
this
do
and
you will live
-
but
wanting
to justify
himself
he said
to
-
Jesus
and
who
is
my
neighbor ?
having replied
-
Jesus
said
a certain man
*
was coming down
from
Jerusalem
to
Jericho
and
robbers
he encountered
who
both
having stripped
him
and
blows
having inflicted
they went away
having left [him]
half dead
by
chance
and
a certain priest
*
was coming down
by
-
way
that ~
and
having seen
him
he passed by on the other side
likewise
and
also
a Levite
having happened
upon
the
place
having come
and
having seen
he passed by on the other side
Samaritan
but
a certain
traveling
came
upon
him
and
having seen [him]
he was filled with compassion
and
having approached
he bandaged
the
wounds
of him
pouring over [them]
oil
and
wine
having placed
and 
him
upon
the (his)
own
animal
he brought
him
to
an inn
and
card for
him
and
on
the
next day
having taken out
he gave
two
denarii
to the
inn keeper
and
said
take care
of him
and
whatever
*
*
you spend in addition
I
when
*
return
I
will repay
you
who
of these
-
three
a neighbor
seems
to you
to have become
to the one
having fallen in
among
the
robbers ?
-
and
he said
the one
having shown
-
mercy
on
him
and said
*
to him
-
Jesus
go
and
you
do
likewise
while
and 
*
went
they 
he
entered
into
a village
certain
woman
and
a certain
by [the] name
Martha
received
him
and
to this [woman]
was
a sister
being called
Mary
who
also
having sat down beside
at
the
feet
of the
Lord
was listening
to the
word
of him
-
but
Martha
was being distracted
about
much
service
having stood by
and 
she said
Lord
no 
is it of ~ concern
to you
that
the
sister
of me
alone
me
left
to serve?
speak
then
to her
that
she may help me
*
and having answered
*
said
to her
the
Lord
Martha
Martha
you are worried
and
troubled
about
many things
one
but 
is
necessary
Mary
for
the
good
part
chose
which
not
will be taken away
from her
and
it came about
* while
* 
he was
*
in
a place
certain
praying
as
he stopped
said
a certain [one]
of the
disciples
of him
to
him
Lord
teach
us
to pray
just as
also
John
taught
the
disciples
of Him
and He said
*
to them
when
you pray
say
Father
let be held in reverence
the
name
of you
let come
the
kingdom
of you
the
bread
of us
-
daily
give
to us
-
each day
*
and
forgive
us
the
sins
of us
for indeed [we]
*
ourselves
are forgiving
everyone
being indebted
to us
and
not 
may you lead
us
into
temptation
and
He said
to
them
who
among
you
will have
a friend
and
will come
to
him
at midnight
and
say
to him
friend
lend
to me
three
loaves
because
a friend
of me
arrived
from
a journey
to
me
and
I do not have
*
what
I will set before
him
and that one
within
having answered
may say
[do] not
to me
troubles
cause
already
the
door
has been shut
and
the
children
of me
with
me
in
the
bed
are
I am not able
*
having arisen
to give
to you [anything]
I say
to you
even if
*
he will not give
*
to him
having arisen
because
he
is
*a friend
of him
yet because of
*
the
persistence
of him
having arisen
he will give
to him
as much as
he needs
and I
tell you
*
ask
and
it will be given
to you
seek
and
you will find
knock
and
it will be opened
to you
for everyone
*
-
asking
receives
and
the one
seeking
finds
and
to the one
knocking
it will be opened
and what
*
among
you
-
father [is there]
will ask
the
son [for]
a fish
and
instead
of a fish
a snake
will give to him?
*
or
even [if]
he will ask
for an egg
will he give
to him
a scorpion?
if
therefore
you
being evil ones
*
know
good gifts
*
to give
to the
children
of you
how much
more
the
father
-
from
heaven
will give
[the] spirit
Holy
to the ones
asking
him
and
he was 
casting out
a demon
and
it
was
mute
it came to pass [when]
and 
the
demon
having come out
spoke
the
mute
and
were amazed
the
crowds
but some
*
of
them
said
by
Beelzebul
the
ruler
of the
demons
he casts out
the
demons
and others
*
testing [him]
a sign
from
heaven
they were seeking
from
him
but he
*
having known
their
*
thoughts
said
to them
every
kingdom
against
itself
having  been divided
is laid waste
and
a house [divided]
against
a house
falls
and if
*
also
-
Satan
against
himself
was divided
how
will stand
the
kingdom
of him?
because
you say
by
Beelzebul [that]
I cast out
*
the
demons
but if
*
I
by
Beelzebul
cast out
the
demons
the
sons
of you
by
whom
do they cast [them] out?
therefore
*
they
your
judges
will be
but if
*
by
[the] finger
of God
I
cast out
the
demons
then
came
upon
you
the
kingdom
-
of God
when
the
strong one
having been well equipped
guards
the
of himself
palace
in
peace
is (are)
the
possessions
of him
when
but 
a stronger one
[than] him
having come
overcomes
him
the
armor
of him
he takes
on
which
he had depended
and
the
spoils
of him
he distributes
the one
not
being
with
me
against
me
is
and
the one
not
gathering
with
me
scatters
when
the
unclean
spirit
goes out
from
the
man
it goes
through
waterless
places
seeking
a resting place
and
not
finding [one]
then
it says
I will return
to
the
house
of me
from where
I came out
and
having come
it finds [it]
having been swept
and
having been put in order
then
it goes
and
takes
other
spirits
more evil
than itself
seven
and
having entered
it dwells
there
and
becomes
the
last [condition]
-
of that man
*
worse
[than] the
first
it cameabout
and
while
*
he says
*
these things
having lifted up
a certain
[her] voice
woman
from
the
crowd
said
to him
blessed [is]
the
womb
-
having carried
you
and
[the] breasts
which
you sucked
but he
*
said
on the contrary
blessed [are]
the ones
hearing
the
word
-
of God
and
observing [it]
and [as] the
*
crowds
are gathering even more
he began
to say
-
this generation
*
an evil generation
*
is
a sign
it is seeking 
and
a sign
will
not be given
to it
except
*
the
sign
of Jonah
for just as
*
became
Jonah
to the
Ninevites
a sign
so
will be
also
the
son
-
of man
-
generation
to this 
[the] queen
of [the] south
will be raised
at
the
judgment
with
the
men
-
of this generation
*
and
she will condemn
them
because
she came
from
the
ends
of the
earth
to hear
the
wisdom
of Solomon
and
behold [one]
greater
[than] Solomon [is]
here
men
Ninevites
will stand up
at
the
judgment
with
-
this generation
*
and
will condemn
it
because
they repented
at
the
preaching
of Jonah
and
behold [one]
greater
[than] Jonah [is]
here
no one
having lit a lamp
*
in
a hidden place
puts [it]
neither
under
the
measuring bucket
but
on
the
lampstand
in order that
the ones
entering
the
light
may see
the
lamp
of the
body
is
the
eye
of you
when
the
eye
of you
is sound
*
then
[the] entire
-
body
of you
is full of light
*
when
but 
sick
it is 
then
the
body
of you
[is] full of darkness
see to it
then [that]
not
the
light
-
in
you
is darkness
*
if
therefore
the
body
of you [is]
whole
full of light
not
having
part
any
dark
it will be
all full of light
*
as
when
the
lamp
with the
light
shines
on you
now while
*
*
(he) spoke
asks
him
a Pharisee
that
he might have a meal
with
him
and having entered
*
he reclined [at table]
and the
*
Pharisee
having seen [this]
was amazed
that
not
first
he did wash
before
the
meal
but said
*
the
Lord
to
him
now
you
-
Pharisees
the
outside
of the
cup
and
the
dish
you clean
but the
*
inside
of  you
is full
of greed
and
wickedness
fools
[did] not
the one
having made
the
outside
also
the
inside
make?
but
the things
being inside
give
[as] alms
and
behold
everything
clean
to you
is
but
woe
to you
-
Pharisees
because
you tithe
the
mint
and
the
rue
and
every
herb
and
you disregard
the
justice
and
the
love
-
of God
these things
but 
it was necessary
to do
and those
not
to disregard
woe
to you
-
Pharisees
because
you love
the
place of honor
in
the
synagogues
and
the
greetings
in
the
marketplaces
woe
to you
because
you are
like
the
graves
-
unmarked
and
-
men
the ones
walking
over
have not known [it]
*
and having answered
*
one
of the
lawyers
says
to him
teacher
[by] saying these things
*
also
us
you insult
-
but
he said
also
to you
-
lawyers
woe
because
you burden
-
men
[with] loads
difficult to carry
and
yourselves
[with] one
of the
fingers
of you
you
do not touch
the
loads
woe
to you
because
you build
the
memorials
of the
prophets
but the
*
fathers
of you
killed
them
therefore
witnesses
you are
and
you are in agreement
with the
works
of the
fathers
of you
because
they
on the one hand
killed
them
but you
*
build [the memorials]
therefore
*
also
the
wisdom
-
of God
said
I will send
to
them
prophets
and
apostles
and
from
them
they will kill
and
persecute
that
may be required
the
blood
of all
the
prophets
-
having been poured out
from
[the] creation
of [the] world
of
-
this generation
*
from
[the] blood
of Abel
to
[the] blood
of Zechariah
the one
having perished
between
the
altar
and
the
house [of God]
yes
I tell
to you
it will be required
from
-
this generation
*
woe
to you
-
lawyers
because
you took
the
key
-
of knowledge
yourselves
you did not enter in
you did not enter in
and
the ones
entering in
you hindered
and from there
he having gone forth
*
began
the
scribes
and
the
Pharisees
to be hostile terribly
*
and
to question closely
him
about
many things
plotting
to catch him
*
[in] something
from
the
mouth
of him
meanwhile
*
having assembled
the
myriads
of the
crowd
so as
to trample on
one another
he began
to say
to
the
disciples
of him
first
pay attention
to yourselves
from
the
leaven
which
is
hypocrisy
of the
Pharisees
and nothing
*
having been concealed
is
which
will not be revealed
*
and
hidden
which
will not be made known
*
so then
*
what things
in
the
darkness
you said
in
the
light
will be heard
and
what
to
the
ear
you spoke
in
the
secret rooms
will be proclaimed
on
the
housetops
now I say
*
to you
the
friends
of me
not
do be afraid
of
the ones
killing
the
body
and
after
these things
not having
*
anything more
*
to do
but I will show
*
you
someone
you should fear
fear
the one
after
the [body]
killing
having
authority
to throw
into
-
gehenna (hell)
yes
I say
to you
fear this one
*
[are] not
five
sparrows
sold
[for] two assarion?
*
and
one
of
them
not
has
been overlooked
before
-
God
but
even
the
hairs
of the
head
of you
all
have been counted
not 
do be afraid
[than] many
sparrows
you are worth more
and I say
*
to you
everyone
whoever
*
confesses
-
me
before
-
men
also
the
son
-
of man
will confess
-
him
before
the
angels
-
of God
but the one
*
having denied
me
before
-
men
will be denied
before
the
angels
-
of God
and
everyone
who
will say
a word
against
the
son
-
of man
it will be forgiven
him
but the one
*
against
the
Holy
Spirit
having blasphemed
will not be forgiven
*
and when
*
they bring in
you
before
the
synagogues
and
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
not 
do worry
how
or
what
you should speak in defense
or
what
you should say
for the
*
Holy
Spirit
will teach
you
in
the same
*
hour
what
it is necessary
to say
and said
*
someone
out of
the
crowd
to him
teacher
speak
to the
brother
of me
to share
with
me
the
inheritance
-
but
he said
to him
man
who
appointed me
*
a judge
or
arbitrator
over
you?
and he said
*
to
them
take care
and
be on guard
from
all
greediness
because
not
in
the
abound[ing]
to anyone
the
life
of him
is
from
the
possessions [belonging]
to him
and he spoke
*
a parable
to
them
saying
man
of a certain
rich
produced a good crop
the
farm
and
he was thinking
within
himself
saying
what
should I do
because
I do not have [a place]
*
where
I will gather
the
fruits
of me?
and
he said
this
I will do
I will tear down
my
-
barns
and
I will build larger ones
*
and
I will gather
there
all
the
grain
and
the
goods
of me
and
I will say
to the
soul
of me
soul
you have
many
goods
storing up
for
many years
*
rest
eat
drink [and]
be merry
but said
*
to him
-
God
foolish [man]
[during] this
-
night
the
soul
of you
-
from
you
now what
*
you prepared
to whom
will it be [given]?
such [is]
the one
storing up
for himself
and
not
toward
God
being rich
and he said
*
to
the
disciples
of him
therefore
*
I say
to you
do not worry
*
for the (your)
life
what
you may eat
nor
for the (your)
body
what
you may clothe yourself with
for the
*
soul
is more
*
-
[than] food
and
the
body [more]
-
[than] clothing
consider
the
ravens
that
they do not sow
*
nor
reap
to which
not
is 
a storeroom
nor
a barn
and
-
God
feeds
them
how much
more
you
are worth
[than] the
birds
and who
*
of
you
[by] worrying
is able
upon
the
lifespan
of him
to add
a cubit?
if
then
not
a little thing [to do]
you are able
why
about
the
rest
do you worry?
consider
the
lilies
how
it grows
it does not labor
*
nor
spin
but I say
*
to you
not [even]
Solomon
in
all
the
glory
of him
clothed himself
like
one
of these
if
and 
in
a field
the
grass
being
today
and
tomorrow
into
an oven
being thrown
-
God
thus
clothes
how much
more
you
o you of little faith
and
you
not
do seek
what
you may eat
and
what
you may drink
and
not 
do be anxious
these things
for
all
the
nations
of the
world
strive for
your
but
-
father
has known
that
you need
these things
but
seek
the
kingdom
of him
and
these things
will be added
to you
not 
do fear
-
little
flock
because
was well pleased
the
father
of you
to give
to you
the
kingdom
sell
the
possessions
of you
and
give
to charity
make
for yourselves
purses
not
becoming old
an treasure
inexhaustible
in
the
heavens
where
a thief
not
does come near
nor
a moth
destroys
for where
*
is
the
treasure
of you
there
also
the
heart
of you
will be
let
your
-
waists
having been girded
and
the
lamps
burning
and
you [should be]
like
men
waiting for
the
Lord
of themselves
when
he returns
from
the
wedding feasts
in order that
having come
and
having knocked
immediately
they may open [the door]
for him
blessed [are]
-
slaves
those 
whom
having come
the
Lord
will find
keeping watch
truly
I say
to you
that
he will dress himself
and
make to recline
them
and
having come beside
he will serve
them
and if
in
the
second
and if
in
the
third
watch
he comes
and
he finds [it]
thus
blessed
are
those
but this
*
know
that
if
had known
the
master of the house
in what
hour
the
thief
comes
not
would 
he have allowed
to be broken into
the
house
of him
and
you
be
prepared
because
in what
hour
you do not think
*
the
son
-
of man
comes
and said
*
-
Peter
Lord
to
us
-
this parable
*
do you speak
or
also
to
all?
and
said
the
Lord
who
then
is
the
faithful [and]
steward
-
wise
whom
will appoint
the
Lord
over
the
servants
of him
-
to give
in
[the] proper time
the
food allowance?
blessed [is]
-
that slave
*
whom
having come
the
Lord
of him
will find
doing
thus
truly
I say
to you
that
over
all
the
possessions
of him
he will appoint
him
but if
*
says
-
that slave
*
in
the
heart
of him
delays
the
master
of me
to come
and
he begins
to beat
the
men servants
and
the
women servants
both to eat
*
and
to drink
and
to become drunk
will come
the
Lord
-
of that slave
*
on
a day
which
he does not expect
*
and
in
an hour
which
he does not know
*
and
will cut in pieces
him
and
the
portion
of him
with
the
unbelievers
will put [him]
and that
*
-
slave
-
having known
the
will
of the
Lord
of him
and
not
having prepared
or
having done
according to
the
will
of him
will be beaten
[with] many [blows]
but the one
*
not
having known
but having done [things]
*
worthy
of blows
will be beaten
[with] few [blows]
but to everyone
*
to whom
much was given
*
much
will be required
from
him
and
to whom
was entrusted
much
even more
they will ask
[from] him
fire
I came
to throw
on
the
earth
and
how
I wish
if
already
it was kindled
and [the] baptism
*
I have
to be baptized [with]
and
how
I am distressed
until
*
it is completed
do you think
that
peace
I came
to bring
on
the
earth?
no,
I tell
you
but
rather
division
for there will be
*
from
-
now
five
in
one
house
having been divided
three
against
two
and
two
against
three
will be divided
father
against
son
and
son
against
father
mother
against
the
daughter
and
daughter
against
the
mother
mother-in-law
against
the
daughter-in-law
of her
and
daughter-in-law
against
the
mother-in-law
and he was saying
*
also
to the
crowds
when
you see
the
cloud
rising
over
[the] west
immediately
you say
-
a rain storm
is coming
and
it happens
thus
and
when [there is]
a south wind
blowing
you say
-
it will be hot
*
and
it happens
hypocrites
the
appearance
of the
earth
and
the
sky
you known [how]
to interpret
-
time
then [that]
this
how [is it]
not 
you do know [how]
to interpret?
why
and
also
for
yourselves
not 
do you judge
[what is]
right?
for as
*
you go away
with
the
opponent
of you
to
a ruler
on
the
road
make an effort
*
to receive a settlement
from
him
lest
he drag
you
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
will hand over you
*
to the
police officer
and
the
police officer
will
throw you
into
jail
I say
to you
by no means
*
may come out
that one
until
even
the
last
lepton
you pay back
now there were present
*
some
at
the same
*
time
reporting
to him
about
the
Galileans
whose
-
blood
Pilate
mixed
with
the
sacrifices
of them
and
having answered
he said
to them
do you think
that
-
these Galileans
*
sinners
above
all
the
Galileans
were
because
* these things?
* they have suffered
no
I tell
to you
but
unless
*
you repent
likewise all [of]
*
you will perish
or
those
-
eighteen
upon
whom
fell
the
tower
in
-
Siloam
and
it killed
them
do you think
that
they
were sinners
*
above
all
the
men
-
living in
Jerusalem?
no
I tell
you
but
unless
*
you repent
*in the same way all [of]
*in the same way all [of]
you will perish
and he was speaking
*
this
-
parable
a fig tree
had
a certain man
having been planted
in
the
vineyard
of him
and
he came
seeking
fruit
on
it
and
he did not find [any]
*
so he said
*
to
the
gardener
behold
three
years
since
*
I come
seeking
fruit
on
-
this fig tree
*
and
I do not find [any]
*
therefore cut down
*
it
why
even
the
soil
is it using up?
-
but
having answered
he says
to him
Lord
leave
it
also
this
-
year
until
*
I may dig
around
it
and
may throw
manure [on it]
and if
indeed
it produces
fruit
in
the
future
otherwise
*
*
*
you will cut down
it
now he was
*
teaching
in
one
of the
synagogues
on
the
Sabbaths
and
behold
a woman
a spirit
having 
of illness
years
eighteen
and
she was 
being bent double
and
not 
being able
to stand upright
completely
*
*
and having seen
*
her
-
Jesus
called out
and
said
to her
woman
you have been set free
from the
illness
of you
and
he placed upon
her
the (his)
hands
and
immediately
she was restored
and
she was glorifying
-
God
and having answered
*
the
synagogue ruler
being indignant
that
on the
Sabbath
healed
-
Jesus
He was saying
to
the crowd
-
six
days
there are
in
which
it is necessary
to work
on
them
therefore
coming
be healed
and
not
on the
day
of the
Sabbath
and answered
*
him
the
Lord
and
said
hypocrites
each
of you
on the
Sabbath
does he not untie
*
the
ox
of him
or
the
donkey
from
the
manger
and
having led it away
it drinks?
but this one
*
a daughter
of Abraham
being
whom
bound
-
Satan
behold
ten
and
eight
years
not
was it ~ necessary [for her]
to be set free
from
-
bond
this
on the
day
of the
Sabbath?
and
[by] saying these things
*
he [by]
were being put to shame
all
the ones
being opposed
to him
and
all
the
crowd
was rejoicing
over
all
the
glorious things
-
being accomplished
by
him
therefore he was saying
*
to what
comparison
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
to what
will I compare
it?
it is like
*
a mustard seed
*
which
having taken
a man
threw
into
a garden
of himself
and
it grew
and
became
-
a tree
and
the
birds
of the
sky
nested
in
the
branches
of it
and
again
he said
to what
will I compare
the
kingdom
-
of God?
it is like
*
leaven
which
a woman having taken
*
hid
in
wheat flour
* measures
* three
* until
*
* was leavened.
* [the] whole [batch]
and
he was traveling
throughout
cities
and
villages
teaching
and
making [his] way
*
to
Jerusalem
and said
*
someone
to him
Lord
if
few [are]
the ones
being saved?
-
and
he said
to
them
strive
to enter
through
the
narrow
door
because
many
I say
to you
will seek
to enter
and
they will not be able to
*
after
*
*
has arisen
the
master of the house
and
he closes
the
door
and
you begin
to stand outside
*
and
to knock [on]
the
door
saying
Lord
open [up]
for us
and
having answered
he will say
to you
I do not know
*
you
from where
you are
then
you will begin
to say
we ate
before
you
and
we drank
and
in
the
streets
of us
you taught
and
he will speak
saying
to you
not
I do know
you
from where
you are
go away
from
me
all
workers
of unrighteousness
there
will be
-
weeping
and
-
gnashing
of the
teeth
when
you will see
Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
and
all
there
prophets
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
but you
*
being thrown out
outside
and
they will come
from
east
and
west
and
from
north
and
south
and
they will recline at table
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
behold
there are
last ones
who
will be
first
and
there are
first ones
who
will be
last
in
the same
*
hour
approached
some
Pharisees
saying
to him
depart
and
go
from here
because
Herod
wants
you
to kill 
and
he said
to them
having gone
tell
-
this fox
*
behold
I cast out
demons
and
I perform healings
*
today
and
tomorrow
and
on the
third [day]
I will be finished
but
it is necessary
for me
today
and
tomorrow
and
the one
following
to travel
because
not
it is possible [for]
a prophet
to die
outside
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
the one
killing
the
prophets
and
stoning
the ones
having been sent
to
her
how often
I wanted
to gather
the
children
of you
in [the] manner which
*
a hen
-
her
chicks [gathers]
under
the (her)
wings
and
not 
you were willing
behold
is left
to you
the
house
of you
but I say
*
to you
you may by no means see
*
*
me
until
will come [the time]
when
you may say
having been blessed [is]
the one
coming
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
and
it came to pass
while
*
he went
*
into
a house
of a certain one
of the
leaders
of the
Pharisees
on [the] Sabbath
to eat
bread
and
they
were watching closely
*
him
and
behold
a man
certain 
was
suffering from dropsy
in front of
him
and
having answered
-
Jesus
spoke
to
the
lawyers
and
Pharisees
saying
is it permissible
on the
Sabbath
to heal
or
not?
-
but
they were silent
and
having taken hold [of him]
he healed
him
and
sent [him] away
and
to
them
he said
who
of you [having]
a son
or
an ox
into
a well
will fall
and
not
immediately
will lift out
him
on
[the] day
of the
Sabbath?
and
they were not able
*
to make a reply
against
these things
he was speaking
and 
to
the ones
having been invited
a parable
noticing
how
the
places of honor
they were choosing
saying
to
them
when
you are invited
by
someone
to
wedding festivities
not
you should recline at table
in
the
places of honor
lest
a more distinguished [person]
[than] you
may have been invited
*
by
him
and
having come
the one
you
and
he
having invited
will say
to you
give
to this one
[your] place
and
then
you will begin
with
shame
the
last
place
to occupy
but
when
you are invited
having gone
recline
in
the
last
place
so that
when
comes
the one
having invited
you
he will say
to you
friend
go up
to a higher [place]
then
will be
to you
glory
before
all
the ones
reclining at table with
you
because
everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
and
the one
humbling
himself
will be exalted
and he was speaking
*
also
to the one
having invited
him
when
you prepare
a luncheon
or
a dinner
not 
do call
the
friends
of you
nor
the
brothers
of you
nor
the ones
related
to you
nor
neighbors
rich 
lest
also
they
should invite in return
you
and
it become
repayment
to you
but
when
you prepare a banquet
*
invite
[the] poor
[the] crippled
[the] lame
[the] blind
and
you will be blessed
*
because
they do not have [the means]
*
to repay
you
for it will be repaid
*
to you
in
the
resurrection
of the
righteous
and having heard
*
a certain one
of the ones
reclining at table with him
these things
said
to him
blessed [is he]
who
will eat
bread
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
-
and
he said
to him
a certain man
*
was preparing
a big dinner
*
and
he invited
many
and
he sent
the
slave
of him
at the
hour
of the
dinner
to say
to the ones
having been invited
come
because
now
ready
it is
and
began
unanimously
*
all
to be excused
the
first
said
to him
I bought a field
*
and
I am compelled
*
having gone out
to see
it
I ask
you
have
me
having been excused
and
another
said
pair
of oxen
I bought
five
and
I am going
to examine
them
I ask
you
have
me
having been excused
and
another
said
I married a woman
*
and
therefore
*
I am not able
*
to come
and
having arrived
the
slave
reported
to the
Lord
of him
these things
then
having been angry
the
master of the house
said
to the
slave
of him
go out
quickly
into
the
streets
and
lanes
of the
city
and
the
poor
and
[the] crippled
and
[the] blind
and
[the] lame
bring [them] in
here
and
said
the
slave
Lord
has been done
what
you commanded
and
still
there is a place
*
and
said
the
Lord
to
the
slave
go out
to
the
roadways
and
fences
and
urge [them]
to come in
in order that
may be filled
my
-
house
for I say
*
to you
that
no one
-
of those men
*
-
having been invited
will taste
my
-
dinner
and were accompanying
*
him
a large crowd
*
and
having turned
he said
to
them
if
someone
comes
to
me
and
does not hate
*
the
father
of himself
and
the
mother
and
the
wife
and
the
children
and
the
brothers
and
the
sisters
and in addition
*
also
the
life
of himself
he is not able
*
to be
my
disciple
whoever
does not carry
*
the
cross
of himself
and
comes
after
me
is not able
*
to be
my
disciple
who
for
among
you
wanting
to build a tower
*
[will] not
first
having sat down
figure out
the
cost
if
he has [enough]
for
completion?
lest
*
having laid
his
foundation
and
not being able
*
to finish [it]
everyone
-
seeing [it]
may begin
him
to ridicule 
saying
-
this
-
man
began
to build
and
was not able
*
to finish
or
what
king
going
another
king
to engage
in
battle
not
having sat down
first
will consider
if
he is able
*
with
ten
thousand
to meet
the one
with
twenty
thousand
having come
against
him
otherwise
*
*
*
while
he
far away
being 
an ambassador
having sent 
he asks
the [terms]
for
peace
so
then
all
of
you
who
does not renounce
*
all
-
his
possessions
is not able
*
to be
my
disciple
good
then [is]
-
salt
but if
*
even
the
salt
should become tasteless
with
what
will it be seasoned?
neither
for
soil
nor
for
manure
is it suitable
*
they throw out
*
it
the one
having
ears
to hear
let that one hear
now there were
*
drawing near to him
*
all
the
tax collectors
and
the
sinners
to listen
to him
and
were complaining
both the
*
Pharisees
and
the
scribes
saying
-
this one
sinners
welcomes
and
eats with
them
and he told
*
to
them
-
this parable
*
saying
what
man
of
you
having
one hundred
sheep
and
having lost
from
them
one
is not leaving
*
the
ninety-nine
*
in
the
wilderness
and
goes
for
the one
having been lost
until
he finds
it?
and
having found [it]
he puts [it]
on
the
shoulders
of him
rejoicing
and
having come
to
the
house
he calls together
-
friends
and
-
neighbors
saying
to them
rejoice together
with me
because
I found
the
sheep
of me
the one
having been lost
I say
to you
that
thus
joy
in
-
heaven
there will be
over
one
sinner
repenting
than
over
ninety-nine
*
righteous
who
no
need
have
of repentance
or
what
woman
drachmas
having
ten
if
she loses
one drachma
*
[will] not
light
a lamp
and
sweep
the
house
and
search
carefully
until
*
she finds it?
and
having found [it]
she calls together
-
friends
and
neighbors
saying
rejoice together
with me
because
I found
the
drachma
which
I lost
thus
I say
to you
there is
joy
before
the
angels
-
of God
over
one
sinner
repenting
and he said
*
a certain man
*
had
two
sons
and
said
the
younger
of them
to the
father
father
give
to me
the
belonging
*
of the
property
-
and
he distributed
to them
the
property
and
after
not
many
days
having gathered together
everything
the
younger
son
went on a journey
to
a country
far away
and
there
he squandered
the
property
of him
living
loosely
and having spent
*
of him
everything
there came
a severe famine
*
throughout
-
that country
*
and
he
began
to go without
and
having come
he became associated
with one
of the
citizens
-
of that country
*
and
he sent
him
into
the
fields
of him
to feed
pigs
and
he was longing
to be fed
with
the
pods
which
were eating
the
pigs
and
no one
was giving [anything]
to him
to
himself
but
having come
he said
how many
hired servants
of the
father
of me [there are]
having leftovers
of bread
I
but ~
with a famine
here
am perishing
having arisen
I will go
to
the
father
of me
and
I will say
to him
father
I sinned
against
-
heaven
and
before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
[the] son
of you
make
me
as
one
of the
hired servants
of you
and
having arisen
he came
to
the
father
of himself
and while
*
he [still]
a distance
being away
saw
him
the
father
of him
and
was filled with compassion
and
having run
he fell
upon
the
neck
of him
and
he kissed
him
and said
*
the
son
to him
father
I sinned
against
-
heaven
and
before
you
no longer
am I
worthy
to be called
[the] son
of you
but said
*
the
father
to
the
slaves
of him
quick
bring out
robe
the
best
and
clothe
him
and
give
a ring
for
the
hand
of him
and
sandals
for
the
feet
and
bring
the
calf
-
fattened [and]
sacrifice [it]
and
having eaten
let us be merry
because
this
-
son
of me
was dead
*
and
he lived again
he had been lost
*
and
he was found
and
they began
to be merry
was
but
the
son
of him
the
older
in
[the] field
and
as
coming
he drew near
to the
house
he heard
music
and
dancing
and
having summoned
one
of the
servants
he was inquiring
what
might be
*
these things
-
and
he said
to him
-
the
brother
of you
is present
and
sacrificed
the
father
of you
the
calf
-
fattened
because
being in good health
he received back him
*
and he was angry
*
and
he did not want
*
to enter
but the
*
father
of him
having come out
was pleading
with him
-
but
having answered
he said
to the
father
of him
behold
so many
years
I serve
you
and
never
a commandment
of you
I disobeyed
and
for me
never
did you give
a young goat
that
with
the
friends
of me
I might be merry
but when
*
-
son
of you
this
the one
having devoured
your
-
property
with
prostitutes
came
you sacrificed
for him
the
fattened
calf
-
and
he said
to him
child
you
always
with
me
are
and
everything [which is]
-
mine
is yours
*
now to be merry
*
and
to rejoice
it was necessary
because
-
brother
of you
this
dead
was
and
he lived
and
having been lost
and
was found
and he was saying
*
also
to
the
disciples
man
a certain 
was
rich
who
had
a steward
and
this
was the charge brought
against him
as
squandering
the
possessions
of him
and
having called
him
he said
to him
what [is]
this
I hear
about
you?
render
the
account
of the
stewardship
of you
no
for
are you able
longer
to be steward
and said
*
within
himself
the
steward
what
may I do
because
the
Lord
of me
takes away
the
stewardship
from
me?
to dig
I am not strong [enough]
*
to beg
I am ashamed
I know
what
I may do
that
when
I am removed
from
the
stewardship
they may receive
me
into
the
houses
of them
and
having summoned
each one
*
of the
debtors
of the
master
of himself
he was saying
to the
first
how much
do you owe
to the
Lord
of me?
-
and
he said
one hundred
baths
of oil
-
and
he said
to him
take
your
-
bills
and
having sat down
quickly
write
fifty
then
to another
he said
and you
*
how much
do you owe?
-
and
he said
one hundred
measures
of wheat
he says
to him
take
your
-
bills
and
write
eighty
and
praised
the
Lord
the
steward
-
unrighteous
because
wisely
he acted
because
the
sons
-
of age
this
more wise
than
the
sons
of the
light
in
the
generation
-
of themselves
are
and
I
say to you
*
for yourselves
*make
friends
from
the
wealth
-
of unrighteousness
that
when
it fails
they may welcome
you
into
the
eternal
tents
the [one]
faithful
in
little
also
in
much
faithful
is 
and
the [one being]
in
little
unrighteous
also
in
much
unrighteous
is
if
then
with
-
unrighteous
wealth
faithful
not
you were 
-
true [riches]
who
to you
*will entrust?
and
if
with
the [things]
belonging to another
faithful
not
you were
-
your own
who
to you
will give?
no
slave
is able
two
master
to serve
for either
*
the
one
he will hate
and
the
other
he will love
or
one
he will be devoted to
and
the
other
he will despise
you are not able
*
to serve God
*
and
wealth
and was hearing
*
these things
all
the
Pharisees
being lovers of money
*
and
they were ridiculing
him
and
he said
to them
you
are
the ones
justifying
yourselves
before
-
men
-
but
God
knows
the
hearts
of you
because
the [thing]
among
men
highly esteemed [is]
an abomination
before
-
God
the
law
and
the
prophets [were proclaimed]
until
John
from
then
the
kingdom
-
of God
is being preached
and
everyone
into
it
is being urgently invited
easier
but 
it is [for]
-
heaven
and
-
earth
to pass away
than
of the
law
one
stroke of a letter
to drop [out]
everyone
-
divorcing
the
wife
of him
and
marrying
another
commits adultery
and
the one
[the woman] having been divorced
by
[her] husband
marrying
commits adultery
man
now
a certain
was
rich
and
was clothing himself
with purple
and
linen
being merry
every day
*
[eating] sumptuously
poor man
and
a certain
by name
Lazarus
had been laid
at
the
gate
of him
having been covered with sores
and
desiring
to be fed
from
the things
falling
from
the
table
of the
rich man
but
even
the
dogs
coming
were licking
the
sores
of him
and it came to pass [that]
*
died
the
poor man
and
was carried away
*he
by
the
angels
to
the
bosom
of Abraham
died
and 
also
the
rich man
and
he was buried
and
in
-
hades
having lifted up
the
eyes
of him
being
in
torments
he sees
Abraham
from
far away
and
Lazarus
in
the
bosoms
of him
and
he
having called
said
Father
Abraham
have mercy
on me
and
send
Lazarus
that
he may dip
the
tip
of the
finger
of him [into]
[the] water
and
may cool
the
tongue
of me
because
I am suffering
in
-
this flame
*
but said
*
Abraham
child
remember
that
you received
the
good things
of you
in
the
life
of you
and
Lazarus
likewise
the
bad
but now
*
here
he is comforted
but you
*
are suffering
and
in [addition]
to all
these things
between
us
and
you
chasm
a great
has been fixed
so that
the ones
wishing
to come over
from [here]
to
you
are not able
*
neither
from there
to
us
may they cross over
and he said
*
I ask
you
then
father
that
you may send
him
to
the
house
of the
father
of me
for I have
*
five
brothers
that
he may warn
them
lest
*
also
they
may come
to
-
this place
*
-
of torment
but says
*
Abraham
they have
Moses
and
the
prophets
let them listen
to them
-
but
he said
no
father
Abraham
but
if
someone
from
[the] dead
should go
to
them
they will repent
but he said
*
to him
if
Moses
and
the
prophets
they do not listen to
*
neither
if
someone
from
[the] dead
should rise again
will they be persuaded
and he said
*
to
the
disciples
of him
it is impossible [for]
*
-
the
temptations to sin
not to come
*
but
woe
through
whom
it comes
it is better
for him
if
a millstone
*
is hung
around
the
neck
of him
and
he had been thrown
into
the
sea
than
that
he should cause to stumble
-
little ones
of these
one
pay attention
to yourselves
if
sins
the
brother
of you
rebuke
him
and
if
he repents
forgive
him
and
if
seven times
[during] the
day
he sins
against
you
and
seven times
he turns around
to
you
saying
I repent
you will forgive
him
and
said
the
apostles
to the
Lord
add
to us
faith
said
and
the
Lord
if
you have
faith
like
a seed
of mustard
you have said
would 
-
mulberry tree
to this 
be uprooted
and
be planted
in
the
sea
and
it have obeyed
would
you
who
but 
among
you
a slave
having
plowing
or
tending sheep
who
having come in
from
the
field
will say
to him
immediately
having come beside
lie down
but
not
will he say
to him
prepare
something [that]
I may eat
and
having wrapped [an apron] about yourself
serve
me
until
I eat
and
drink
and
after
these things
may eat
and
drink
you?
[surely] not 
he does have
gratitude
to the
servant
because
he did
the things
having been commanded?
so
also
you
when
you do
all
the things
having been commanded
you
say
-
slaves
useless
we are
what
we were obligated
to do
we have done
and
it came about
while [he]
*
goes
to
Jerusalem
and
he
was traveling
through
[the] middle
of Samaria
and
Galilee
and
entering
he
into
a certain
village
met
him
ten
leprous
men
who
stood
from a distance
and
they
lifted up
voice
saying
Jesus
master
have mercy
[upon] us
and
having seen [this]
he said
to them
having gone
show
yourselves
to the
priests
and
it came about
while
*
go away
they
they were cleansed
one
and
of
them
having seen
that
he was healed
returned
with
voice
a loud
glorifying
-
God
and
he fell
on [his]
face
at
the
feet
of him
thanking
him
and
he
was
a Samaritan
having answered
and 
-
Jesus
said
[were there] not
-
ten [who]
were cleansed?
now the
*
nine
where [are they] ?
not
were  they found
having returned
to give
glory
-
to God
except
*
-
this foreigner?
*
and
he said
to him
having arisen
go
the
faith
of you
has delivered
you
having been asked
now 
by
the
Pharisees
when
comes
the
kingdom
-
of God
he answered
them
and
said
is not coming
*
the
kingdom
-
of God
with
observation
nor
will they say
behold
here [it is]
or
there [it is]
behold
for
the
kingdom
-
of God
inside
of you
is
and he said
*
to
the
disciples
will come
days
when
you will desire
one
of the
days
of the
son
-
of man
to see
and
not
you will see [it]
and
they will say
to you
behold
there [it is]
or
behold
here [it is]
not
do go out [after them]
nor
pursue [them]
for as
*
the
lightning
flashing
out of
the [one part]
under
the
sky
to
the [other part]
under
[the] sky
shines
thus
will be
the
son
-
of man
in
the
day
of him]
first
but
it is necessary [for]
him
many things
*to suffer
and
to be rejected
by
-
generation
this 
and
just as
it was
in
the
days
of Noah
thus
will it be
also
in
the
days
of the
son
-
of man
they were eating
drinking
marrying
[and] being given in marriage
until
which
day
entered
Noah
into
the
ark
and
came
the
flood
and
it destroyed
everything
likewise
just as
it was
in
the
days
of Lot
they were eating
drinking
buying
selling
planting [and]
building
on which
but
day
went out
Lot
from
Sodom
it rained
fire
and
sulphur
from
heaven
and
destroyed
everything
according to
the
same things
it will be
on which
day
the
son
-
of man
is revealed
on
that
-
day
who
will be
on
the
roof
and
the
property
of him [will be]
in
the
house
not
let him come down
to take
them
and
the one
in
a field
likewise
not
let him turn back
to
the things
behind
remember
the
wife
of Lot
whoever
*
seeks
the
life
of him
to preserve
will lose
it
whoever
but 
*
loses [it]
will preserve
it
I say
to you
in this
-
night
there will be
two
in
bed
one 
the
one
will be taken
and
the
other
will be left
there will be
two
grinding
at
the
same [place]
the
one
will be taken
the
but 
other
will be left
and
having answered
they say
to him
where
Lord ?
-
but
he said
to them
where
the
body [is]
there
also
the
eagles
will be gathered together
he was speaking
now 
a parable
to them
about [how]
-
it is necessary
always [for]
to pray
them
and
not 
to lose heart
saying
judge
a certain
was
in
a certain
city
-
God
not
fearing
and
man
not
respecting
a widow
now
was
in
-
city
that
and
she was coming
to
him
saying
grant justice
to me
against
the
opponent
of me
and
not
he was willing
for
a time
after
but 
these things
he said
within
himself
if
indeed
-
God
not
I do fear
nor
man
do I respect
because
yet 
-
causes
me
trouble
-
widow
this 
I will grant justice
to her
lest
*
in
[the] end
coming
she may wear out
me
said
now 
the
Lord
listen to
what
the
judge
-
unrighteous
says
-
now [will not] 
God
by all means 
*
bring about
the
justice
of the
chosen ones
of him
-
crying out
to him
day
and
night
and
he has patience
with
them?
I say
to you
that
he will bring about
the
justice
of them
with
speed
but
the
son
-
of man
having come
then
will he find
-
faith
on
the
earth?
he said
and
also
to
some
the ones
having put confidence
in
themselves
that
they are
righteous
and
despising
-
others
-
this parable
*
men
two 
went up
to
the
temple
to pray
-
one [was a]
Pharisee
and
the
other
a tax collector
the
Pharisee
having stood
to
himself
these things
was praying
-
God
I thank
you
that
not
I am 
like
-
other
-
men
swindlers
unrighteous
adulterers
or
even
as
this
-
tax collector
I fast
twice [during]
the
week
I tithe
everything
as much as
I get
but the
*
tax collector
at a distance
having stood
not
was willing
even
the
eyes
to raise up
to
-
heaven
but
was beating
the
chest
of him
saying
-
God
have mercy on
me
the
sinner
I say
to you
went down
this one
having been justified
to
the
house
of him [rather]
than
that one
because
everyone
-
exalting
himself
will be humbled
but the one
*
humbling
himself
will be exalted
they were bringing
now
to him
also
-
infants
that
them
he might touch
but having seen [this]
*
the
disciples
were rebuking
them
-
but
Jesus
called for
them
saying
permit
the
children
to come
to
me
and
not
do hinder
them
-
for
of such ones
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
truly
I say
to you
whoever
*
not
does welcome
the
kingdom
-
of God
as
a child
may by no means
*
enter
into
it
and
questioned
a certain
him
ruler
saying
teacher
good
what
having done
life
eternal
will I inherit?
said
and 
to him
-
Jesus
why
me
do you call 
good ?
no one [is]
good
except
*
alone
-
God
the
commandments
you know
not 
do commit adultery
not 
do commit murder
not
do steal
not 
do bear false witness
honor
the
father
of you
and
the
mother
-
and
he said
these things
all 
I kept
from [my]
youth
having heard
and
-
Jesus
said
to him
still
one [thing]
for you
is lacking
everything
as much as
you have
sell
and
distribute
to the poor
and
you will have
treasure
in
the
heavens
and
come
follow
me
-
but
having heard
these things
very sad
he became 
he was
for 
rich
very
having seen
and
him
-
Jesus
very sad
having become
said
how
with difficulty
the ones
-
wealth
having
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
enter
easier
for
it is [for]
a camel
through
[the] opening
of a needle
to enter
than [for]
a rich person
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
to enter
said
but 
the ones
having heard
and
who
is able
to be saved?
-
and
he said
the things
impossible
with
men
possible
with
-
God
are
and said
*
-
Peter
behold
we
having left
-
our own
followed
you
-
and
he said
to them
truly
I say
to you
that
no one
there is
who
left
house
or
wife
or
brothers
or
parents
or
children
because
of the
kingdom
-
of God
who
not 
*
will receive
many times as much
in
-
time
this
and
in
the
age
-
coming
life
eternal
having taken
and 
the
twelve
he said
to
them
behold
we are going up
to
Jerusalem
and
will be fulfilled
all
the things
having been written
by
the
prophets
about the
son
-
of man
he will be delivered up
for 
to the
Gentiles
and
he will be ridiculed
and
he will be mistreated
and
he will be spat upon
and
having whipped [him]
they will kill
him
and
on the
day
-
third
he will rise again
and
they
none
of these things
understood
and
had been
-
this word
*
hidden
from
them
and
not
they were  understanding
the things
being said
it came about
and
while
*
drew near
he 
to
Jericho
blind man
a certain 
was sitting
beside
the
road
begging
having heard
and 
a crowd
traveling through
he was asking
what
might be
this
they reported
and 
to him
that
Jesus
the
Nazarene
is going by
and
he cried out
saying
Jesus
son
of David
have mercy on
me
and
the ones
going before [him]
were rebuking
him
that
he should be silent
he
but 
much
more
was crying out
son
of David
have mercy on
me
and having stood
*
-
Jesus
commanded
him
to be led
to
him
having drawn near
and
he
questioned
him
what
for you
do you wish [that]
I may do?
-
and
he said
Lord
that
I may regain my sight
and
-
Jesus
said
to him
regain your sight
the
faith
of you
has healed
you
and
at once
he saw again
and
was following
him
glorifying
-
God
and
all
the
people
having seen [this]
gave
praise
-
to God
and
having entered
he was passing through
-
Jericho
and
behold
a man
by name
being called
Zacchaeus
and
he
was
a chief tax collector
and
he [was]
wealthy
and
he was seeking
to see
-
Jesus
who
he is
and
not
was able
from
the
crowd
because
-
in stature
he was short
*
and
having run ahead
to
the
front
he climbed up
onto
a sycamore fig tree
that
he might see
him
because
[by] that [way]
he was about
to pass by
and
as
he came
to
the
place
having looked up
-
Jesus
said
to
him
Zacchaeus
having hurried
come down
for today
*
in
the
house
of you
it is necessary
for me
to remain
and
having hurried
he came down
and
welcomed
him
with joy
and
all having seen [this]
*
were complaining
saying
-
with
a sinful
man
he entered
to rest
having stood
and 
Zacchaeus
said
to
the
Lord
behold
-
half
of my
-
possessions
Lord
to the
poor
I give
and
if
[from] someone
I defrauded of anything
*
I am paying back
four times
and said
*
to
him
-
Jesus
-
today
salvation
-
to this house
*
came
because
also
he
a son
of Abraham
is
came
for
the
son
-
of man
to seek
and
to save
the
lost
now hearing
*
they
these things
having added
he told
a parable
because
-
near
to be
to Jerusalam
him
and
they think
*
that
immediately
is about
the
kingdom
-
of God
to appear
then he said
*
a certain man
*
of noble birth
traveled
to
country
a distant
to receive
for himself
a kingdom
and
to return
and having called
*
ten
slaves
of himself
he gave
to them
ten
minas
and
he said
to
them
conduct business
while
*
I am coming
but the
*
citizens
of him
were hating
him
and
they sent
an ambassador
after
him
saying
we do not want
*
this one
to rule
over
us
and
it came about
while
*
he returned
*
having received
the
kingdom
and
he said
to be called
to him
-
these slaves
*
to whom
he had given
the
money
that
he might know
what
they gained by trading
and having come
*
the
first
saying
Lord
the
mina
of you
ten
gained
*minas
and
he said
to him
excellent
good
slave
because
in
[the] smallest [thing]
faithful
you were
be
having authority
*
over
ten
cities
and
came
the
second
saying
the
mina
of you
Lord
made
five
minas
and he said
*
also
to this one
and
you
over
be 
five
cities
and
the
other
came
saying
Lord
behold
the
mina
of you
which
I had
being put away
in
a napkin
for I was fearing
*
you
because
a man
of strictness
you are
you take
what
you did not deposit
*
and
you reap
what
you did not sow
*
he says
to him
from
the
mouth
of you
I will judge
you
evil
slave
you had known
that
I
a man
of strictness
am
taking
what
not
I did deposit
and
reaping
what
not
I did sow?
and
why
*
not
did you give
me
the
money
on
a [banker's] table?
and I
having come
with
interest
-
it
collected
and
to the ones
having stood nearby
he said
take
from
him
the
mina
and
give [it]
to the one
the
ten
minas
having
and
they said
to him
Lord
he has
ten
minas
I say
to you
that
to everyone
-
having
it will be given
but from
*
the one
not having
*
even
what
he has
will be taken away
but
-
enemies
of me
these
the ones
not 
having wanted
me
to rule
over
them
bring
here
and
execute
them
before
me
and
having said
these things
he was traveling
ahead
going up
to
Jerusalem
and
it came about
as
he came near
to
Bethphage
and
Bethany
to
the
mountain
the one
being called
of Olives
he sent
two
of the
disciples
saying
go
into
the
opposite
village
in
which
entering
you will find
a colt
having been tied
upon
which
no one
ever
of men
sat
and
having untied
it
bring [it here]
and
if
someone
you
asks 
why
*
are you untying [it]?
thus
you will say
that
the
Lord
of it
need
has 
having departed
and 
the ones
having been sent
found [it]
just as
he told
them
[while] untying
and
them
the
colt
said
the
masters
of it
to
them
why
are you untying
the
colt ?
-
and
they said
-
the
Lord
of it
has need
*
and
they led
it
to
-
Jesus
and
having thrown
their
-
garments
on
the
colt
they put on [it]
-
Jesus
and [while] going
*
he
they were spreading out
the
garments
of them
on
the
road
and nearing
*
him
already
to
the
descent
of the
mount
-
of Olives
began
all
the
multitude
of the
disciples
rejoicing
to praise
-
God
with a loud voice
*
about
all
which
they saw
[the] miracles
saying
having been blessed [is]
the one
coming
the
king
in
[the] name
of [the] Lord
in
heaven
peace
and
glory
in
[the] highest
and
some
of the
Pharisees
from
the
crowd
said
to
him
teacher
rebuke
the
disciples
of you
and
having answered
he said
I say
to you
if
these
will be silent
the
stones
will cry out
and
as
he came near
having seen
the
city
he cried
over
it
saying
-
if
you knew
in
-
this day
*
even
you
the things
[leading] to
peace
but now
*
it was hidden
from
[the] eyes
of you
because
will come
days
upon
you
and
will construct
the
enemies
of you
an embankment
against you
and
they will surround
you
and
will hem in
you
from all directions
and
they will dash to the ground
you
and
the
children
of you
with
you
and
they will not leave
*
a stone
upon
stone
within
you
because
*
did not 
you know
the
time
of the
visitation
of you
and
having entered
into
the
temple
he began
to throw out
the ones
selling
saying
to them
it has been written
and
will be
the
house
of me
a house
of prayer
but you
*
made it
*
a cave
of robbers
and
he was
teaching
-
*
daily
in
the
temple
but the
*
chief priests
and
the
scribes
were seeking
him
to kill 
and [also]
the
leading men
of the
people
and
they were not finding
*
-
what
they might do
the
people
for
all
hung upon
him
listening
and
it came about
on
one
of the
days
he teaching
*
the
people
in
the
temple
and
preaching the good news [and]
stood by
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
with
the
elders
and
they spoke
saying
to
him
tell
us
by
what
authority
these things
you do
or
who
is
the one
having given
to you
-
authority?
this
and having answered
*
he said
to
them
will question
you
I also
a word
and
you tell
me
the
baptism
of John
from
heaven
was it
or
from
men?
-
and
they reason
to
themselves
saying
-
if
we say
from
heaven
he will say
why
*
did you not believe
*
him?
but if
*
we say
from
men
the
people
all
will stone
us
for having been convinced
*
is
John
a prophet
to be [considered]
and
they answered
not
to know
from where [it came]
and
-
Jesus
said
to them
neither
I
am telling
you
by
what
authority
these things
I do
and he began
*
to
the
people
to tell
-
this parable
*
a certain man
*
planted
a vineyard
and
leased
it
to farmers
and
he went away [for]
time
a long
and
in season
he sent
to
the
farmers
a slave
that
from
the
fruit
of the
vineyard
they will give
to him
but the
*
farmers
sent out
him
empty having beaten [him]
*
and
he proceeded
another
to send
slave
-
but
he also
having beaten
and
having dishonored
they sent out
empty
and
he proceeded
a third [time]
to send [someone]
-
and
also
this one
having wounded
they threw out
and said
*
the
Lord
of the
vineyard
what
should I do?
I will send
the
son
of me
-
beloved
perhaps
this one
they will respect
having seen
but
him
the
farmers
were reasoning
with
one another
saying
this one
is
the
heir
let us kill
him
that
ours
may become
the
inheritance
and
having driven out
him
outside
the
vineyard
they killed [him]
what
then
will do
to them
the
Lord
of the
vineyard?
he will come
and
will destroy
-
these farmers
*
and
will give
the
vineyard
to others
having heard [this]
and 
they said
never 
may it be
-
but
having looked at
them
he said
what
then
is
this
having been written
*
[the] stone
which
rejected
the
builders
this one
came to be
for
[the] head
of [the] corner?
everyone
*
having fallen
upon
that
-
stone
will be broken into pieces
whoever
upon
and 
would
it falls
it will crush
him
and
sought
the
scribes
and
the
chief priests
to lay
upon
him
the (their)
hands
in
the same
*
hour
and
they were afraid of
the
people
they knew
for
that
against
them
he spoke
-
this parable
*
and
having watched carefully
they sent
spies
pretending
themselves
righteous
to be
that
they might catch [him in]
his
word
so as
to deliver
him
to the
rulers
and
the
authorities
of the
governor
and
they questioned
him
saying
teacher
we know
that
rightly
you speak
and
you teach
and
you do not receive
*
a face
but
on the basis of
truth
the
way
-
of God
you teach
is it permissible
for us
to Caesar
a tax
to pay
or
not?
but having noticed
*
their
-
craftiness
he said
to
them
show
me
a denarius
of whom
has it
an image
and
inscription?
-
and
they said
of Caesar
-
and
he said
to
them
then
give
the things
of Caesar
to Caesar
and
the things
-
of God
-
to God
and
they were not able
*
to catch [him in]
his
word
before
the
people
and
having marveled
at
the
answer
of him
they were silent
and having approached
*
some
of the
Sadducees
the ones
speaking against
[the] resurrection [saying it]
is not to be
*
they questioned
him
saying
teacher
Moses
wrote
to us
if
someone's
brother
dies
having
a wife
and
this one
childless
is
that
should take
the
brother
of him
the
wife
and
he should raise up
a seed
to the
brother
of him
then seven
*
brothers
there were
and
the
first
having taken
[the] wife
died
childless
and
the
second
and
the
third
took
her
and likewise
*
also
the
seven
did not leave behind
*
a child
and
they [all] died
and finally
*
the
woman
died
the
woman
then
in
the
resurrection
of which
of them
does she become
[the] wife?
-
for
seven
had
her [as]
wife
and
said
to them
-
Jesus
the
sons
-
of this age
*
marry
and
are given in marriage
but the ones
*
having been considered worthy
-
of that age
*
to attain
and
of the
resurrection
from the
*
dead
neither
marry
nor
are given in marriage
for neither
*
to die
is it possible any longer
*
like angels
for
they are
and
sons
of God they are
*
of the
resurrection
sons
being
but that
*
are raised
the
dead
even
Moses
revealed
at
the
[burning] bush
as
he calls
[the] Lord
the
God
of Abraham
and
[the] God
of Isaac
and
[the] God
of Jacob
God
but 
not
is 
of dead persons
but
of living ones
all
for 
to him
are alive
having answered
and 
some
of the
scribes
said
teacher
well
you spoke 
for no longer
*
were they daring
to question
him
anything
and he said
*
to
them
how
do they say
the
Christ
to be
David's
son?
for himself
*
David
says
in
[the] book
of Psalms
said
[the] Lord
to the
Lord
of me
sit down
at
[the] right
of me
until
*
I put
the
enemies
of you [as]
a footstool
of the
feet
of you
therefore David
*
Lord
calls him
*
and
how
his
son
is he?
hearing
and [while]
all
the
people
he said
to the
disciples
of him
beware
of
the
scribes
the ones
wanting
to walk around
in
long robes
and
loving
formal greetings
in
the
market places
and
[the] chief seats
in
the
synagogues
and
[the] places of honor
at
the
banquets
who
devour
the
houses
of the
widows
and
with false pretense
they pray lengthy [prayers]
*
these
will receive
greater
judgment
and having looked up
*
he saw
the ones
putting
into
the
treasury
the
gifts
of them
[the] wealthy
and he saw
*
a certain
widow
poor
putting [in]
there
leptas
two 
and
he said
truly
I say
to you
that
-
widow
this
-
poor
more [than] 
everyone
put [in]
for all
*
these
from
the things
abounding
to them
they put
in
the
gifts
this [widow]
but
out of
the
need
of her
all
the
means
which
she had
she has put [in]
and [as]
some
[were] speaking
about
the
temple
that
with stones
beautiful 
and
with sacred gifts
it has been decorated
he said
these things
which
you see
will come
days 
in
which
not 
there will be left
a stone
upon
a stone
which
not
will be thrown down
and they questioned
*
him
saying
teacher
when
therefore
these things
will be
and
what [will be]
the
sign
when
are about
these things
to take place ?
-
and
he said
beware
not
you should be deceived
many
for 
will come
in
the
name
of me
saying
I
am [he]
and
the
time
has drawn near
not 
do go
after
them
whenever
but 
you hear [about]
wars
and
insurrections
not
do be frightened
it is necessary [for]
for
these things
to occur
first
but [it is]
not
immediately
the
end
then
he was saying
to them
will be raised up
nation
against
nation
and
kingdom
against
kingdom
earthquakes
both
great
and
in various
places
famines
and
plagues
there will be
horrors
both 
and
from
heaven
signs
great 
there will be
but before
*
these things
all 
they will lay
on
you
the
hands
of them
and
they will persecute [you]
handing [you] over
to
the
synagogues
and
jails
being led away
to
kings
and
governors
because of
the
name
of me
it will turn out
for you [to be an opportunity]
for
testimony
keep
therefore 
in
the
hearts
of you
not 
to prepare
to defend [yourselves]
I
for 
will give
to you
a mouth
and
wisdom
which
not
will be able
to resist
or
to contradict
all
the ones
being opposed
to you
you will be handed over
and 
also
by
parents
and
brothers
and
relatives
and
friends
and
they will put to death [some]
of
you
and
you will be 
hated
by
everyone
because of
the
name
of me
and
a hair
of
the
head
of you
by no means
*
may perish
in
the
endurance
of you
you will gain
the
souls
of you
but when
*
you see
being surrounded
by
armies
Jerusalem
then
know
that
has drawn near
the
devastation
of it
then
the ones
in
-
Judea
flee
to
the
mountains
and
the ones
in
[the] midst
of her
let them get out
and
the ones
in
the
fields
let them not enter
*
into
it
because
days
of vengeance
these
are
-
to be fulfilled
all
the things
having been written
woe
to the ones
in
[the] womb
having [a child]
and
to the ones
nursing
in
those
-
days
there will be
for
distress
great 
upon
the
land
and
anger
-
[against]  people
this
and
they will fall
by [the] edge
of [the] sword
and
they will be led captive
into
the
nations
all
and
Jerusalem
will be trampled
*
by
Gentiles
until
*
are fulfilled
[the] times
of [the] Gentiles
and
there will be
signs
in
[the] sun
and
[the] moon
and
[the] stars
and
upon
the
earth
[the] dismay
of [the] Gentiles
in
perplexity [at]
[the] sound
of [the] sea
and
[the] surf [and]
fainting
men
from
fear
and
expectation
of the things
coming upon
the
World
the
for 
powers
of the
heavens
will be shaken
and
then
you will see
the
son
-
of man
coming
on
a cloud
with
power
and
glory
great
[when] beginning
and
these things
to occur
stand erect
and
lift up
the
heads
of you
because
draws near
the
redemption
of you
and
he told
a parable
to them
you see
the
fig tree
and
all
the
trees
when
puts out [leaves]
already
seeing
for
yourselves
you know
that
already
near
the
summer
is
thus
also
you
when
you see
these things
happening
you know
that
near
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
truly
I say
to you
that
not
*
will pass away
-
generation
this 
until
*
all [these things]
may occur
-
heaven
and
-
earth
will pass away
the
but 
words
of me
by no means
*
will pass away
pay attention
and 
to yourselves
lest
may be burdened
your
-
hearts
with
dissipation
and
drunkenness
and
anxieties
of life
and
may come
upon
you
suddenly
-
day
that 
as
a trap
[it] will come
for 
upon
all
the ones
sitting
on
[the] face
of all
the
earth
be alert
but 
at
every
time
praying
that
you may be able
to escape
all these things
*
-
being about
to happen
and
to stand
before
the
son
-
of man
he was [in those]
now 
-
days
in
the
temple
teaching
[during] the
and
nights
going out
he was spending
in
the
mountain
the one
being called
of olives
and
all
the
people
were getting up early [to come]
to
him
in
the
temple
to hear
him
was coming near
and
the
feast
-
of unleavened bread
the one
being called
[the] Passover
and
were seeking
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
-
how
they might destroy
him
for they were afraid of
*
the
people
and entered
*
Satan
into
Judas
the one
being called
Iscariot
being
of
the
number
of the
twelve
and
having departed
he spoke with
the
chief priests
and
captains of the temple
-
how
he might hand over to them
*
him
and
they rejoiced
and
they agreed
him
money
to pay
and
he consented
and
he was seeking
an opportunity
-
to betray
him
without
a crowd
[with] them
came
now 
the
day
-
of unleavened bread
in
which
it was necessary
to sacrifice
the
Passover lamb
and
he sent
Peter
and
John
having said
having gone
prepare
for us
the
Passover
that
we may eat
-
and
they said
to him
where
do you wish [that]
we should prepare [it]?
-
and
he said
to them
behold
having entered
you
into
the
city
will meet
you
a man
a jar
of water
carrying
follow
him
into
the
house
into
which
he enters
and
you will say
to the
master
of the
house
says
to you
the
teacher
where
is
the
guest room
where
the
Passover
with
the
disciples
of me
I may eat ?
and that one
you
will show 
upstairs room
a large 
having been furnished
there
prepare [it]
and having departed
and having departed
they found [things]
just as
he had told
them
and
they prepared
the
Passover
and
when
came
the
hour
he reclined  [at table]
and
the
apostles [were]
with
him
and
he said
to
them
with [great] desire
I desired
this
-
Passover
to eat
with
you
before
-
me (I)
suffer
for I say
*
to you
that
I may by no means eat
*
*
it
until
*
it is fulfilled
in
the
kingdom
-
of God
and
having taken
a cup
having given thanks
he said
take
this
and
share [it]
among
yourselves
for I say
*
to you
that
by no means may I drink
*
*
from
-
now
from
the
fruit
of the
vine
until
*
the
kingdom
-
of God
comes
and
having taken
bread [and]
having given thanks
he broke [it]
and
gave [it]
to them
saying
this
is
the
body
of me
-
for
you
being given
this
do
in
-
my
memory
and
the
cup
similarly
after
-
[they] ate
saying
this
-
cup [is]
the
new
covenant
in
the
blood
of me
-
for
you
being shed
nevertheless
behold
the
hand
of the one
betraying
me [is]
with
me
on
the
table
because
the
son
indeed
-
of man
according to
the thing
having been determined
goes
but
woe
-
to that man
*
through
whom
he is betrayed
and
they
began
to discuss
among
themselves
-
who
then
it might be
of
them
-
this
being about
to do
and there came about
*
also
a dispute
among
them
-
[as to] who
of them
seems
to be
greater
-
and
he said
to them
the
kings
of the
nations
Lord it over
them
and
the ones
being in authority over
them
are called benefactors
*
but [with] you [it is]
*
not
so
but
the one
being greater
among
you
let him become
as
the
youngest
and
the one
leading
as
the one
serving
for who [is]
*
greater
the one
reclining at table
or
the one
serving ?
[is it] not
the one
reclining at table?
but I
*
in
[the] midst
of you
am
as
the one
serving
you
but
are
the ones
having remained
with
me
in
the
temptations
of me
and I
decree
to you
just as
decreed
to me
the
father
of me
[the] kingdom
that
you may eat
and
drink
at
the
table
of me
in
the
kingdom
of me
and
you will sit
upon
thrones
the
twelve
tribes
judging
-
of Israel
Simon
Simon
behold
-
Satan
asked for
you
-
to sift [you]
like
-
wheat
but I
*
prayed
for
you
that
may not fail
*
the
faith
of you
and
when you
*
having returned
strengthen
the
brothers
of you
-
but
he said
to him
Lord
with
you
prepared
I am
even
to
jail
and
to
death
to go
-
but
he said
I tell
you
Peter
will not crow
*
today
a rooster
until
three [times]
me
you deny
to know
and
he said
to them
when
I sent
you
without
a purse
and
a beggar bag
and
sandals
not
anything
were you in need ?
-
and
they said
nothing
and he said
*
to them
but
now
the one
having
a purse
let him take [it]
likewise
also
a beggar's bag
and
the one
not
having
let him sell
the
garment
of him
and
let him buy
a sword
for I say
*
to you
that
this
-
having been written
it is necessary
to be fulfilled
in
me
-
and
with
lawless persons
he was numbered
for even
*
the thing
concerning
me
has an end
*
-
and
they said
Lord
behold
swords
here [are]
two
-
and
he said
to them
it is enough
*
and
having gone out
he went
according to
the (his)
habit
to
the
mountain
-
of olives
and followed
*
him
also
the
disciples
and having come
*
to
the
place
he said
to them
pray [so as ]
not
to enter
into
temptation
and
he
was withdrawn
from
them
about
[the] throw of a stone
*
and
having bent
the
knees
he was praying
saying
father
if
you are willing
take away
this
-
cup
from
me
nevertheless
not
the
will
of me
but
-
yours
let it be
and appeared
*
to him
an angel
from
heaven
strengthening
him
and
having been
in
agony
he was praying more fervently
*
and
became
the
sweat
of him
as
drops
of  blood
falling down
upon
the
ground
and
having arisen
from
-
prayer [and]
having come
to
the
disciples
he found
them sleeping
*
from
-
grief
and
he said
to them
why
are you sleeping ?
having arisen
pray
lest
*
you enter
into
temptation
yet
him
speaking
behold
a crowd
and
the one
being called
Judas
one
of the
twelve
was going before
them
and
he drew near
-
to Jesus
to kiss
him
Jesus
and
said
to him
Judas
with a kiss
the
son
-
of man
do you betray ?
having seen
but 
the ones
around
him
the thing
going to be
they said
Lord
if
we will strike
with
a sword ?
and
struck
a certain one
*
of
them
of the
chief priest
the
slave
and
cut off
the
ear
of him
the
right [one]
and having answered
*
-
Jesus
said
stop !
[no] more
of this !
and
having touched
the
ear
he healed
him
and said
*
Jesus
to
the ones
having come
against
him
[the] chief priests
and
captains
of the
temple
and
[the] elders
as
against
a thief
did you come out
with
swords
and
clubs ?
daily
*
being
me
with
you
in
the
temple
you did not
stretch out
the (your)
hands
against
me
but
this
is
your
-
hour
and
the
authority
-
of darkness
and having seized
*
him
they led [him] away
and
brought [him]
into
the
house
of the
chief priest
-
and
Peter
was following
from a distance
and [they] having kindled
*
a fire
in
[the] middle
of the
courtyard
and
having sat down together
was sitting
-
Peter
[in the] middle
of them
and having seen
*
him
servant girl
a certain
sitting
near
the
light
and
having looked intently
at him
she said
and
this one
with
him
was
-
but
he denied [it]
saying
I do not know
*
him
woman
and
after
a short [while]
another
having seen
him
said
and
you
of
them
are
-
but
Peter
said
man
I am not
*
and
having passed
about
one hour [and]
*
other
a certain
was insisting
saying
based on
truth
also
this one
with
him
was
for also
*
a Galilean
he is
said
but 
-
Peter
man
not 
I do know
what
you are saying
and
immediately
while
speaking
him 
crowed
a rooster
and
having turned
the
Lord
looked at
-
Peter
and
was reminded
-
Peter
of the
word
of the
Lord
when
he said
to him
-
before
a rooster
crows
today
you will deny
me
three [times]
and
having gone
outside
he cried
bitterly
and
the
men
the ones
having in custody
him
were ridiculing
him [and]
beating [him]
and
having blind folded
him
they were questioning [him]
saying
prophesy
who
is
the one
having hit
you?
and
many other things
*
blaspheming
they were speaking
against
him
and
when
it became
day
were gathered together
the
elders
of the
people
both [the] chief priests
*
and
[the] scribes
and
they led away
him
to
the
council
of them
saying
if
you
are
the
Christ
tell
us
but he said
*
to them
if
I say [this] to you
*
you
will by no means believe
*
and if
*
I question [you]
you will by no means answer
*
*
from
-
now [on]
but
will be
the
son
-
of man
sitting
at
[the] right
of the
power
-
of God
and said
*
everyone
then you
*
are
the
son
-
of God ?
-
and
to
them
he said
you
are saying
that
I
am
-
and
they said
why
still
do we have
need of a witness?
*
for ourselves
*
we heard
from
the
mouth
of him
and
having arisen
[the] whole
-
multitude
of them
led
him
before
-
Pilate
they began
and 
to accuse
him
saying
this one
we found
misleading
the
nation
of us
and
forbidding
taxes
to Caesar
to be paid
and
calling
himself
Christ [and That he Is ]
a king
to be
-
and
Pilate
questioned
him
saying
you
are 
the
king
of the
Jews?
-
and
having answered
him
he said
you
are saying
-
and
Pilate
said
to
the
chief priests
and
the
crowds
I find no
*
guilt
in
-
this man
*
they
but
were insisting
saying
-
he incites
the
people
teaching
throughout
all
-
of Judea
-
having begun
from
-
Galilee
to
here
Pilate
and
having heard
questioned
if
the
man
a Galilean
is
and
having learned
that
of
the
authority
of Herod
he is
he sent
him
to
Herod
being
also
him
in
Jerusalem
in
these
-
days
-
and
Herod
having seen
-
Jesus
rejoiced
greatly
he was
for
from
a long
time
wanting
to see
him
because
-
[he] hears [things]
about
him
and
he was hoping
some
sign
to see
by
him
being performed
he was questioning
and 
him
with
words
many
he
but
nothing
answered 
to him
and had stood
*
the
chief priests
and
the
scribes
vehemently
accusing
him
having treated with contempt
and ~
him
even
-
Herod
with
the
troops
of him
also
having ridiculed [him]
having clothed [him in]
clothing
bright
they sent back
him
-
to Pilate
became
*
friends
-
both
Herod
and
-
Pilate
on
this very
-
day
with
one another
they were previously
for
at
enmity
being
towards
themselves
and Pilate
*
having called together
the
chief priests
and
the
authorities
and
the
people
said
to
them
you brought
to me
-
man
this 
as
causing to revolt
the
people
and
behold
I
before
you
having examined  [him]
nothing
found 
in
-
man
this
[of the] crime
of which
you make accusations
against
him
and
neither [did]
Herod
he sent back
for 
him
to
us
and
behold
nothing
worthy
of death
has 
been done
by him
having disciplined
therefore 
him
I will release [him]
but they cried out
*
all together
saying
take away
this one
release
and 
to us
-
Barabbas
who
was
because of
insurrection
some 
having occurred
in
the
city
and
a murder
thrown
into
-
Jail
and again
*
-
Pilate
addressed
them
wishing
to release
-
Jesus
-
but
they were crying out
saying
crucify [him]
crucify
him
-
and
a third [time]
he said
to
them
why 
what
evil
did
this one?
no
crime [worthy]
of death
did I find
in
him
therefore having disciplined
*
him
I will release [him]
-
but
they insisted
with voices
loud 
demanding
him
to be crucified
and
were prevailing
the
voices
of them
and
Pilate
decided
to be done
the
demand
of them
he released
and 
the one
on account of
an insurrection
and
murder
having been thrown
into
a jail
whom
they were requesting
-
but
Jesus
he delivered over
to the
will
of them
and
as
they led away
him
having seized
a Certain Simon
*
a Cyrenian
coming
from
[the] country
they put upon
him
the
cross
to carry
following
-
Jesus
were following
and 
him
a great
multitude
of the
people
and
women
who
were mourning
and
lamenting
for him
and having turned
*
to
them
-
Jesus
said
daughters
of Jerusalem
do not cry
*
for
me
but
for
yourselves
cry
and
for
the
children
of you
because
behold
are coming
days 
in
which
they will say
blessed [are]
the
barren
and
the
wombs
which
not
did bear
and
[the] breasts
which
not
did nurse
then
they will begin
to say
to the
mountains
fall
on
us
and
to the
hills
bury
us
because
if
while
*
full of moisture
a tree [is]
these things
they do 
while [it is]
*
dry
what
may happen?
were being led away
and 
also
other
criminals
two
with
him
to be executed
and
when
they came
upon
the
place
-
being called
[the] skull
there
they crucified
him
and
the
criminals
one
*
on
[the] right [and]
one
*
on
[the] left
-
but
Jesus
was saying
Father
forgive
them
not
for
they know
what
they are doing
and dividing up
*
the
garments
of him
they cast
lots
and
had stood
the
people
watching
and were mocking [him]
*
also
the
authorities
saying
others
he saved
let him save
himself
if
this one
is
the
Christ
-
of God
the
chosen [one]
and ridiculed
*
him
also
the
soldiers
approaching
wine vinegar
offering
to him
and
saying
if
you
are
the
king
of the
Jews
save
yourself
there was
and
also
an inscription
over
him
the
king
of the
Jews [is]
this one
one
and ~
of the
having been hung [with him]
criminals
was blaspheming
him
saying
not
you
are
the
Christ ?
save
yourself
and
us
having answered
and 
the
other
rebuking
him
said
not
do you fear
[for] yourself
-
God
because
in
the
same [state of]
condemnation
you are?
and
we
indeed
justly
things worthy
for 
of which
we did
we are receiving
this one
but 
nothing
wrong
did
and
he was saying
Jesus
remember
me
when
you come
into
the
kingdom
of you
and
he said
to him
truly
I say to you
*
today
with
me
you will be
in
-
paradise
and
it was
already
about
[the] sixth hour
*
and
darkness
was
over
[the] whole
-
land
until
[the] ninth hour
*
the
Sun
having been eclipsed
was torn
and 
the
curtain
of the
temple
in two
and
having cried out
with a loud voice
*
-
Jesus
said
father
into
[the] hands
of you
I entrust
the
spirit
of me
this
and 
having said
he breathed out [his last]
having seen
and 
the
centurion
the thing
having happened
he was glorifying
-
God
saying
surely
-
this man
*
righteous
was 
and
all
the
having gathered together
crowds 
at
-
spectacle
this 
having observed
the things
having happened
beating
the (their)
chests
were returning
had stood
and 
all
the
relatives
to him
from
a distance
and
[the] women
the ones
following
him
from
-
Galilee
seeing
these things
and
behold
a man
by name
Joseph
being a member of [the]council
*
and
a man
good 
and
righteous
this one
not
had
consented with
the
council
and
the
action
of them
from
Arimathea
a city
-
of Judea
who
was waiting for
the
kingdom
-
of God
this one
having approached
-
Pilate
asked for
the
body
-
of Jesus
and
having taken down [the body]
he wrapped
it
in linen
and
placed
it
in
a tomb
hewn
where
not
was
anyone
yet
laid
and
[the] day
it was
of preparation
and
[the] Sabbath
was dawning
having followed after
and 
the
women
who
had
come
out of
-
Galilee
with him
saw
the
tomb
and
how
was laid
the
body
of him
having returned
and 
they prepared
spices
and
ointments
and
on the
-
Sabbath
they rested
according to
the
commandment
on the
but
first [day]
of the
week
very early in the morning
*
to
the
tomb
they came
bringing
what
spices they prepared
*
they found
but
the
stone
having been rolled away
from
the
tomb
having entered
and
not
they did ~ find
the
body
of the
Lord
Jesus
and
it came about
while
*
are uncertain
they
about
this
and
behold
two men
*
stood by
them
in
clothing
dazzling
afraid
and
having become
they
and
bowing
the (their)
faces
to
the
ground
they said
to
them
why
are you seeking
the one
living
among
the
dead?
not
he is 
here
but
was raised
remember
how
he spoke
to you
while
being
in
-
Galilee
saying
the
son
-
of man
-
it is necessary
to be delivered over
into
[the] hands
of sinful men
*
and
to be crucified
and
on the
third
day
to rise again
and
they remembered
the
words
of him
and
having returned
from
the
tomb
they reported
all these things
*
to the
eleven
and
to all
the
others
there were
now 
-
Mary Magdalene
*
and
Joanna
and
Mary
the [mother]
of James
and
the
others
with
them
they were telling
to
the
apostles
these things
and
appeared
before
them
as
nonsense
-
these words
*
and
they were disbelieving
them
-
but
Peter
having arisen
ran
to
the
tomb
and
having bent over
he sees
the
linen cloths
only
and
he departed
to
himself [about]
wondering
the thing
having happened
and
behold
two
of
them
on
the same
*
day
were
traveling
to
a village
being distant
stadia
sixty
from
Jerusalem
to which [is]
[the] name
Emmaus
and
they
were speaking
to
one another
concerning
all
-
things having happened
these
and
it came about
while
*
they talking
*
and
discussing [these things]
also
himself
Jesus
having come near
was traveling with
them
but the eyes
*
*
of them
were held
-
not
to recognize
him
and he said
*
to
them
what
-
words [are]
these
which
you are exchanging
with
one another
walking along?
and
they stood [with]
a sad look
having answered
and
one
by name
Cleopas
said
to
him
[are] you
[the] only one
visiting
Jerusalem
and
you do not know
*
the things
having happened
in
it
in
-
days?
these 
and
he said
to them
what things?
-
and
they said
to him
the things
about
Jesus
the
Nazarene
who
was
a man
a prophet
powerful
in
deed
and
word
before
-
God
and
all
the
people
how
both
delivered over
him
the
chief priests
and
the
authorities
of us
to
a condemnation
of death
and
they crucified
him
but we
*
were hoping
that
he
is
the one
about
to redeem
-
Israel
but
-
also
with
all
these things
[the] third
this 
day
passes
from
which
these things
came about
but
also
some women
*
among
us
amazed
us
having been
early
at
the
tomb
and
not having found
*
the
body
of him
they came
saying
also
a vision
of angels
to have seen
who
say
him
to live
and
departed
some
of the ones
with
us
to
the
tomb
and
they found [it]
so
just as
also
the
women
said
but him
*
they did not see
*
and
he
said
to
them
o
foolish ones
and
slow
-
in heart
-
to believe
in
all
which
spoke
the
prophets
[was it] not
these things
necessary [for]
to suffer
the
Christ
and
to enter
into
the
glory
of him?
and
having begun
from
Moses
and
from
all
the
prophets
he explained
to them
in
all
the
scriptures
the things
concerning
himself
and
they drew near
to
the
village
where
they were traveling
and
he
acted as though
to travel farther
*
and
they strongly urged
him
saying
stay
with
us
because
towards
evening
it is
and
has declined
already
the
day
and
he entered
-
to stay
with
them
and
it came about
while
*
he was reclining at table
*
with
them
having taken
the
bread
he blessed [it]
and
having broken [it]
he was giving [it]
to them
and of them
*
were opened
the
eyes
and
they recognized
him
and
he
became invisible
*
from
them
and
they said
to
one another
[were] not
the
heart [s]
of us
burning
*
within
us
as
he was speaking
to us
on
the
road
as
he was opening
to us
the
scriptures?
and
having arisen
this very
-
hour
they returned
to
Jerusalem
and
they found
having been gathered together
the
eleven
and
the ones
with
them
saying
that
really
was raised
the
Lord
and
he appeared
to Simon
and
they
were explaining
the things
on
the
road
and
how
he was made known
to them
in
the
breaking
of the
bread
and [while] these things
*
they
speaking
he
stood
in
[the] midst
of them
and
he says
to them
peace
to you
having been startled
but 
and
afraid
having been 
they were thinking
a spirit
to see 
and
he said
to them
why
have you been troubled
*
and
why [do]
*
doubts
arise
in
the
heart [s]
of you?
you see
the
hands
of me
and
the
feet
of me
that
I
am
myself
touch
me
and
see
because
a spirit
flesh
and
bones
does not have
*
as
you see me
*
having
and
this
having said
he showed
them
the (his)
hands
and
the (his)
feet
and still
*
disbelieving
them
from
the
joy
and
being amazed
he said
to them
have you
some
food
here?
-
and
they gave
him
fish
of a broiled
a part
and
having taken [it]
before
them
he ate [it]
and he said
*
to
them
these
-
words
of me
which
I spoke
to
you
while
being
with
you
that
it is necessary
to be fulfilled
all
the things
having been written
in
the
law
of Moses
and
the
prophets
and
[the] Psalms
about
me
then
he opened up
their
-
mind[s]
-
to understand
the
scriptures
and
he said
to them
-
thus
it has been written
to suffer
the
Christ
and
to rise again
from
[the] dead
on the
third
day
and
to be preached
in
the
name
of him
repentance
for
[the] forgiveness
of sins
to
all
the
nations
having begun
from
Jerusalem
you [are to be]
witnesses
of these things
and
behold
I
send
the
promise
of the
father
of me
to
you
you
but
sit
in
the
city
until
*
you may be clothed with
from
[the] heights
power
and he led out
*
them
outside
as far as
to
Bethany
and
having lifted up
the
hands
of him
he blessed
them
and
it came about
while
*
blesses
he 
them
he went away
from
them
and
was being taken up
into
-
heaven
and
they
having worshiped
him
returned
to
Jerusalem
with
great joy
*
and
they were
continually
*
in
the
temple
blessing
-
God
In
[the] beginning
was
the
Word,
and
the
Word
was
with
-
God,
and
God
was
the
Word.
This one
was
in
[the] beginning
with
-
God.
All things
through
him
came to be,
and
without
him
came to be
not
one thing.
That which
came into being
in
him
life,
was ~ 
and
the
life
was
the
light
-
of men;
and
the
light
in
the
darkness
shines
and
the
darkness
it
not
did grasp
(There) came
a man
having been sent
from
God,
name
to him
John.
This one
came
for
testimony,
that
he might testify
about
the
light,
that
all
may believe
through
him.
~ not
was ~
That one ~
the
light,
But [he came]
that
he might testify
about
the
light.
He was
the
light,
the
true one
which
enlightens
every
man,
coming
into
the
world.
In
the
world
he was,
and
the
world
through
him
came to be,
and
the
world
~ him.
~ not ~
did ~ recognize
To
his
own
he came,
and
his
own
~ him.
~ not ~
did ~ receive
~ as many as
But ~
received
him,
he gave
to them
[the] right
children
of God
to become,
to the ones
believing
in
the
name
of him,
the ones
not
of
bloods
bloods
of
[the] will
of flesh
nor
of
[the] will
of a husband
but
of
God
were born.
And
the
word
~ flesh
became
and
tabernacled
among
us,
and
we gazed [upon]
the
glory
of him,
glory
as
of an only one
from
[the] father,
full
of grace
and
truth.
John
testifies
about
him
and
has cried out
saying,
This one
was he
[as to]whom
I said,
the one
after
me
coming
before
me
has become,
because
prior to
me
he was.
Because
from
the
fullness
of him,
we
all
received
even
grace
on top of
grace.
because
the
law
through
Moses
was given,
the
grace
and
the
truth.
through
Jesus
Christ
came.
God
no one
has seen
ever;
an only one,
God,
the one
being
in
the
bosom
of the
father,
that one
explaned[him].
And
This one
is
the
testimony
-
of John
when
sent
to
him
the
Jews
from
Jerusalem
priests
and
Levites
that
they might ask
him,
you
who
are?
And
he confessed
and
did not
deny,
and
he confessed
-
I
not
am
the
Christ.
And
they asked
him,
what
then?
you
Elijah
are?
And
he says,
I am
not.
The
prophet
are
you?
And
he answered,
no.
They said
then?
to him,
who
are you?
that
an answer
we may give
to the ones
having sent
us.
what
do you say
about
yourself?
He said,
I [am]
a voice
crying
in
the
wilderness,
make straight
the
way
of [the] Lord,
as
said
Isaiah
the
prophet.
And
the ones having been sent
were
of
the
Pharisees.
And
they asked
him,
and
said
to him,
why
then
do you baptize
if
you
not
are
the
Christ
nor
Elijah
nor
the
prophet?
Answered
them
-
John
saying,
I
baptize
in
water;
among
you
has stood
one whom
you
do not
perceive,
the one
after
me
coming,
of whom
not
am
I
worthy
that
I should untie
of him
the
thong
of the(his)
sandal.
These things
in
Bethany
happened
beyond
the
Jordan,
where
was
the one
John
baptizing.
On the
next day
he sees
-
Jesus
coming
to
him
and
he says,
look,
the
lamb
-
of God,
the one
taking away
the
sin
of the
world.
This one
is [he]
on behalf
of whom
I
said,
after
me
comes
a man
who
before
me
has become,
because
prior to
me
he was.
And I
not
did recognize
him,
but
that
he might be manifested
-
to Isreal
therefore
therefore
came
I
in
water
baptizing.
And
testified
John
saying
-
I have seen
the
spirit
descending
as
a dove
out of
heaven
and
it remained
upon
him.
And I
did not
recognize
him,
but
the one
having sent
me
to baptize
in
water
that one
to me
said,
upon
whomever
*
you see
the
spirit
descending
and
remaining
upon
him,
this
is
the one
baptizing
in
[the]holy
~spirit.
And
I have seen
and
I have testified
that
this one
is
the
son
-
of God.
On the
next day
again
stood
-
John
and
of.
the
disciples
of him
two,
and
having looked at
-
Jesus
walking
he says,
look,
the
lamb
-
of God.
And
heard
the
two
disciples
him
speaking
and
they followed
-
Jesus.
~ having turned
And ~
-
Jesus
and
having seen
them
following
says
to them,
what
do you seek?
~they
And ~
said,
to him,
Rabbi,
which
means,

teacher,
where
are you staying?
He says
to them,
come
and
see.
They went
therefore
and
saw
where
he stays
and
with
him
remained
-
day
that ~
[The] hour
was
about
[the] tenth.
[It] was
Andrew,
the
brother
of Simon
Peter,
one
of
the
two
-
having heard
from
John
and
having followed
him.
~ finds
This one ~
first
-
brother
his
own
Simon
and
says
to him,
we have found
the
Messiah,
which
means,

Christ.
He led
him
to
-
Jesus.
having looked at
him
-
Jesus
said,
you
are
Simon,
the
son
of John,
you
will be called
Cephas,
which
is translated
Peter.
On the
next day
he wanted
to go out
into
-
Galilee
and
he finds
Philip.
And
says
to him,
-
Jesus,
following
me.
Was
now
-
Philip
from
Bethsaida,
of
the
city
of Andrew
and
Peter.
~ finds
Philip
-
Nathaniel
and
says
to him,
[He] whom
~ wrote [of]
Moses
in
the
law-
and also
the
prophets-
we have found,
Jesus,
[the] son
-
of Joseph
-
from
Nazareth.
And
said
to him
Nathaniel,
out of
Nazareth
can
anything
good
be?
Says
to him
-
Philip,
come
and
see.
Saw
-
Jesus
-
Nathaniel
coming
to
him
and
says
about
him,
look,
a genuine
Israelite
in
whom
guile
is not
*
Says
to him
Nathaniel,
how
me
do you know?
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him,
before
-
you
Philip
called
being
under
the
fig tree
I saw
you.
Answered
him
Nathaniel,
Rabbi,
you
are
the
son
-
of God,
you
king
are ~
-
of Israel.
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to him,
because
I told
you
that
I saw
you
underneath
the
fig  tree,
do you believe?
Greater
things
you will see.
And
he says
to him,
truly,
truly,
I say
to you,
you will see
-
heaven
having been opened
and
the
angels
-
of God
ascending
and
descending
on the
the
son
-
of man.
and
on the
day
-
third
a wedding
there was
in
Cana

and
was

of Jesus
there.

And ~
both

Jesus
and

to
the

And
(when)  ~ was lacking

says
the
mother

of Jesus
to
him,

And
says
to her
-
Jesus,

to me
and
to you,
woman?
Not yet

the
hour
of me.
Says
the

of him
to the

Says
to them
-
Jesus,

the
waterjars

And
they filled
them
up to
(the) top.
And
he says
to them,

And-

the

and
says
to him,
every

and
when

[he sets out] the

You

This
performed
beginning
-
of signs
-
Jesus
in
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
he manifested
the
glory
of him,
and
believed
in
him
the
disciples
of him.
After
this
went down
to
Capernaum
he
and
the
mother
of him
and
the
brothers
of him
and
the
disciples
of him,
and
there
tey remained
not
many
days.
And
near
was
the
passover
of the
Jews,
and
went up
to
Jerusalem
-
Jesus.
And
he found
in
the
temple
the ones
selling
oxen
and
sheep
and
doves
and
the
coin dealers
sitting,
and
having made
a whip
out of
ropes
everyone
he threw
out of
the
temple,
the
both
sheep
and
the
oxen,
and
of the
moneychangers
he poured out
the
coins,
and
the
tables
he overturned.
And
to the ones
-
doves
selling
he said,
take
these things
from there,
do not
make
the
house
of the
father
of me
a house
of merchandising.
Remembered
the
disciples
of him
that
having been written
is,
the
zeal
for the
house
of you
will devour
me.
Answered
then
the
Jews
and
said
to him,
what
sign
do you show
us
that
these things
you do?
Answered
Jesus
and
said
to them,
destroy
-
sanctuary
this-
and
in
three
days
I will raise
it.
Said
then
the
Jews,
in forty
and
six
years

and
you
in

days

it?
~ that one
But ~
was speaking
about
the
sanctuary
of the
body
of him.
~ when
Therefore ~
he was raised
from
(the)dead,
remembered
the
disciples
of him
that
this
he was saying,
and
they believed
the
scripture
and
the
word
which
said
-
Jesus.
when
And-
he was
in
-
Jerusalem
during
the
passover
at
the
feast,
many
believed (trusted)
in
the
name
of him,
seeing
his
-
signs
which
he was doing.
Himself
but
Jesus
was not
entrusting
himself
to them
because
-
he
knows
all (men),
and
because
no
need
he had
that
anyone
should testify
about

~ when

knew

Jesus
that
heard
the

that
Jesus
more
disciples
makes
and
baptizes
than
John -
although
Jesus
himself
~ not ~
did ~ baptize

the

of him -
he left

Judea
and
departed
again
into

Galilee.
~ it was necessary [for]
and ~
him
to pass
through

he comes
therefore
into
a city
-
of Samaria
being called
Sychar
near
the
parcel
which
~ gave
Jacob ~
-
to Joseph
the
son
of him.
~ there was
now ~
there
a well
-
of Jacob.
-
then
Jesus
having become weary
from
the
journey
was sitting
thus
at
the
well;
hour
it was
about
[the] sixth.
comes
a woman
of
-
Samaria
to draw
water.
says
to her
-
Jesus,
give
me
to drink;
the
for ~
disciples
of him
had gone away
into
the
city
that
food
they might buy.
says
therefore
to him
the
woman,
the
Samaritan,
how [can]
you
* being ~ a Jew
*
from
me
to [be given] drink
ask
woman
a Samaritan
being?
*(for do not associate
*
*
Jews
with Samaritans.)
answered
Jesus
and
said
to her,
if
you knew
the
gift
-
of God
and
who
is
the one
saying
to you,
give
me
to drink,
you
would have
asked
him
and
*he would have given
*
you
*living ~ water.
*
says
to him
the
woman,
sir,
no
bucket
you have
and
the
well
is
deep.
from where
then
do you have
the
water
-
living?
[surely] not
you
greater [than]
are
the
father
of us,
Jacob,
who
gave
us
the
well
and
himself
from
it
drank
and
the
sons
of him
and
the
cattle
of him?
answered
Jesus
and
said
to her,
*everyone
*
drinking
from
-
~ water
this ~
will thirst
again.
~whoever
but ~
*
drinks
of
the
water
which
I
will give
to him
* never
*
will thirst
into
the
age
but
the
water
which
I will give
him
will become
into
him
a fountain
of water
springing up
into
life
eternal
says
to
him
the
woman,
sir
give
me
this
-
water
that
not
I may ~ thirst
nor
come
here
to draw [water]
he says
to her,
go
call
the
husband
of you
and
come
here
answered
the
woman,
and
said
to him
*I do not have
*
a husband
says
to her,
-
Jesus
well
you said
-
a husband
not 
I do have
~ five
for ~
husbands
you had
and
now
the one
you have
*is not
*
your
husband
this
truly
you have said
says
to him
the
woman,
sir
I see
that
a prophet
*you~are
*
the
fathers
of us,
on
-
*this~mountain
*
worshiped
and
you
say
that
in
Jerusalem
is
the
place
where
to worship
it is necessary 
says
to her,
-
Jesus
believe
me
woman,
that
comes
an hour
when
neither
on
-
*this~mountain
*
nor
in
Jerusalem
you will worship
the
father
you
worshiped
that which
*you do not know
*
we
worshiped
that which
we know
because
-
salvation
from
the
Jews
is
but
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
the
\\"\\"true\\"\\
worshipers
will worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
truth
indeed
for
the
father
~ such
is seeking~
ones
worshiping
him
spirit
-
god [is]
and
the ones
worshiping
him
in
spirit
and
truth
it is necessary [for]
to worship
says
to him
the
woman,
I know
that
a Messiah
is coming
the one
being called
Christ
when
comes
that one
he will declare
to us
everything
says
to her,
-
Jesus
I
am [he]
the one
speaking
to you
and
at
this [time]
came
the
disciples
of him
and
they were marveling
that
with
a woman
he was speaking
no one
however
said
what
are you seeking
or
why
do you speak
with
her
*therefore~left
*
the
waterpot
of her
the
woman,
and
went away
into
the
city
and
says
to the
men
comes
see
a man
who
told
me
all things
whatsoever
I did
[surely] not
this one
is
the
Christ
they came
out of
the
city
and
were coming
to
him
into
the
meanwhile
were asking
him
the
disciples
saying
rabbi
eat
-
but
he said
to them
I
~ food
have ~
to eat
which
you
~ not ~
do ~ know [about]
were saying
therefore
the
disciples
to
one another
[surely]
no one
brought
him
[anything] to eat
says
to them
-
Jesus
my
food
is
that
I may do
the
will
of the one
having sent
me
and
may complete
his
-
work
not 
you 
do say
-
yet
four months
it is
and
the
harvest
comes
look
I say
to you
lift up
the
eyes
of you
and
see
the
fields
that
white
they are
for
harvest
already
the one
reaping
wages
receives
and
gathers
fruit
into
life
eternal
in order that
the one
sowing
together
may rejoice
and
the one
reaping
~ in
for~
this
the
word
is
\\"\\"true\\"\\
-
another
is
the one
sowing
and
another
the one
reaping
I
sent
you
to reap
that which
~ not ~
you ~
have ~ labored [upon]
others
have labored
and
you
into
the
labor
of them
have entered
of
and~
-
city
that ~
many
believed
in
him
of the
Samaritans
because of
the
word
of the
woman
testifying
-
he told
me
all things
which
I did
~ when
then ~
came
to
him
the
Samaritans
they were asking
him
to remain
with
them
and
he remained
there
two
days
and
many
more
believed
because of
the
word
of him
*and~to the
*
woman
they were saying
-
no longer
because of
-
your
talk
do we believe
~ we ourselves
for~
have heard
and
we know
that which
this one
is
truly
the
savior
of the
world
~ after
and ~
the
two
days
he went out
from there
into
-
Galilee
himself
for
Jesus
testified
that
a prophet
into
*his own
*
country
honor
~ not ~
does ~ have
~ when
therefore
he came
into
-
Galilee
received
him
the
Galileans
all things
having seen
which
he did
in
Jerusalem
during
the
feast
also
they
for
went
to
the
feast
he came
therefore
again
into
-
Cana
-
of Galilee,
where
he made
the
water
wine
and
there was
a certain
royal official
whose
-
son
was ill
in
Capernaum.
this man,
having heard
that
Jesus
comes
from
-
Judea
into
-
Galilee,
went
to
him
and
was asking
that
he would come down
and
cure
his
-
son,
~ he was about
for ~
to die.
said
therefore
-
Jesus
to
him,
*except
*
signs
and
wonders
you see,
* never
*
you believe
says
to
him
the
royal official,
lord,
come down
before
dies
the
child
of me.
says
to him
-
Jesus,
go,
the
son
of you
lives.
believed
the
man
the
word
which
said
to him
-
Jesus
and
he went.
already
and ~
~ he
*[while] ~ was going down
the
slaves
of him
met
him
saying
that
the
child
of him
lives.
~ he inquired
therefore ~
the
time
from
them
in
which
better
he became
they said
then ~
to him,
-
yesterday [at]
[the] seventh ~ hour
*
left
him
the
fever.
*therefore ~knew
*
the
father
that [it was]
in
the same
-
hour
in
which
said
to him
-
Jesus,
the
son
of you
lives,
and
*he believed
*
and
the
household
of him
all.
~ this
and ~
again
a second
sign
did
-
Jesus
having come
from
-
Judea
into
-
Galilee.
after
these things
there was
a feast
of the
Jews,
and
went up
Jesus
to
Jerusalem.
~ there is
now ~
in
-
Jerusalem
at
the
sheepgate
a pool,
the one
being called
in Hebrew
Bethzatha,
five
porches
having.
in
these
were laying
a multitude
of the ones
being ill,
blind,
lame,
withered.
~ there was
and
a certain
man
there
thirty
and
eight
years
having [been]
in
-
~ sickness.
his ~
this man
seeing
-
Jesus
lying
and
having known
that
much
~ already
time
he has [been thus],
says
to him,
do you want
*to become ~ healthy?
*
answered
him
the one
being ill,
sir,
a man
not
I  do have
that
when
is troubled
the
water
he may put
me
into
the
pool.
while
*
but
am coming
I
another
before
me
goes down.
says
to him
-
Jesus,
rise,
take
the
mat
of you
and
walk.
and
immediately
became
healthy
the
man
and
he took
the
mat
of him
and
was walking around.
it was
and ~
a sabbath
on
that
-
day.
were saying
therefore
the
Jews
to the one
having been healed,
*it is ~ [the] sabbath,
*
so
~ not ~
it is ~ lawful
for you
to carry
the
mat
of you.
the man
but
answered
them,
the one
having made
me
healthy,
that one
~ to me,
said ~
take up
the
mat
of you
and
walk.
they asked
him,
who
is
the
man
-
telling
you.
take up [your mat]
and
walk?
*but ~ the one
*
having been healed
*did not know
*
who
it is,
-
for
Jesus
slipped out -
a crowd
* [there] being ~
in
the
place.
after
these things
finds
him
-
Jesus
in
the
temple
and
said
to him,
look,
*you have become ~ healthy,
*
no longer
sin,
*lest
*
worse
to you
something
happens.
went away
the
man
and
reported
to the
Jews
that
Jesus
is
the one
having made
him
healthy.
and
because of
this
persecuted
the
Jews
-
Jesus,
because
these  things
he was doing
on
a sabbath.
-
but
Jesus
answered
them,
the
father
of me
until
now
is working
and I
am working.
because of
this
therefore
[all the] more
were seeking
him
the
Jews
to kill,
because
not
only
was he breaking
the
sabbath,
but
also
*[his] own ~ father
*
he was saying
the [very]
god [to be]
equal
himself
making
to the [very]
god.
answered
therefore
-
Jesus
and
was saying
to them,
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
*is not able
*
the
son
to do
from
himself
anything
*except
*
what
he sees
the
father
doing,
what
for
things
that one
is doing
these things
also
the
son
likewise
is doing.
*for ~ the
*
father
is fond of
the
son
and
all things
he shows
to him,
which
he
does,
and
greater
than these
he will show
him
works,
that one
you
may marvel.
~ just as
for ~
the
father
raises
the
dead
and
makes [them] alive,
so
also
the
son
whom
he wills
makes alive.
~ not even
for ~
the
father
Judges
anyone,
but
-
*all ~ judgment
*
he has given
to the
son,
that
all men
may honor
the
son
as
they honor
the
father.
the one
not
honoring
the
son
not
does ~ honor
the
father,
the one
having sent
him.
truly,
truly
I say
to you
that
the one
the
word
of me
hearing
and
believing
the one
having sent
me
has
life
eternal
and
into
judgment
*he does not come,
*
but
has been transferred
out of
-
death
into
-
life.
truly,
truly
I say
to you
that
is coming
an hour
and
now
is
when
the
dead
will hear
the
voice
of the
son
-
of god
and
the ones
having heard
will live.
*for ~ just as
*
the
father
has
life
in
himself,
so
also
the
son
he gave
life
to have
in
himself.
and
authority
he gave
to him
*to make ~ judgment,
*
because
[the] son
of man
he is.
not
do marvel
[at] this,
for
is coming
an hour
in
which
all
the ones
in
the
graves
will hear
the
voice
of him
and
will come out,
the ones
the
good things
having done
to
a resurrection
of life,
*but ~ the ones
*
the
evil things
having practised
to
a resurrection
of judgment.
*I ~ am not able
*
*
to do
from
myself
anything.
as
I hear
I judge,
and
the
judgment
-
of me
just
is,
because
~ not ~
I do ~ seek
the
will
-
of me
but
the
will
of the one
having sent
me.
if
I
testify
about
myself,
the
testimony
of me
not
is
true.
another
is
the one
testifying
about
me,
and
I know
that
\\"\\"true\\"\\
is
the
testimony
which
he testifies
about
me.
you
have sent
to
John,
and
he has testified
to the
truth.
~ I
but
not
from
man
the
testimony
receive,
but
these things
I say
that
you
may be saved.
that one
was
the
lamp
-
burning
and
shining,
*and ~ you
*
chose
to exult
for
a time
in
the
light
of him.
*but ~ i
*
have
-
testimony
greater [than]
-
John's.
*for ~ the
*
works
which
has given
to me
the
father
that
I should finish
them,
these
-
works
which
I do
testify
about
me
that
the
father
~ me.
has sent ~
and
the
having sent
me
father,
that one
has testified
about
me.
neither
[the] voice
of him.
ever
have you heard
nor
[the] visage
of him
have you seen,
and
the
word
of him
you
do not have
in
you
abiding,
because
[he] whom
he sent,
that one
this one
you
*do not believe.
*
you search
the
scriptures,
because
you
think
in
them
life
eternal
to have;
and
those
are
the ones
testifying
about
me.
and
do not
you want
to come
to
me
that
~ life.
you may have ~
glory
from
men
~ not ~
I do ~ receive,
but
I have known
you
that
the
love
-
of god
not
you do have
in
yourselves.
I
have come
in
the
name
of the
father
of me,
and
you
do not receive
me.
if
another
comes
in
-
name
his
own,
that one
you will receive.
how
*are you able
*
to believe,
glory
from
one another
receiving,
and
the
glory
-
from
the
only
god
you
do not seek?
not 
do think
that
I
will accuse
you
to
the
father,
there is
one
accusing
you,
Moses,
in
whom
you
have hoped.
if
for ~
you were believing
Moses,
*you would have believed
*
me;
~ concerning
for
me
that one
wrote.
if
but ~
the
of that one
writings
you
do not believe,
how
-
my
words
will you believe?
after
these things
departed
-
Jesus
beyond
the
sea
-
of Galilee,
-
of Tiberias.
~ were following
and
him
a crowd,
great
because
they were seeing
the
signs
which
he was doing
on
the ones
being ill.
*and ~ went up
*
to
the
mountain
Jesus
and
there
he was sitting
with
the
disciples
of him.
~ was
and
near
the
passover,
the
feast
of the
Jews.
~ having lifted up
therefore
the (his)
eyes
-
Jesus
and
having seen
that
a great
crowd
is coming
to
him
he says
to
Philip,
from where
may we buy
bread
that
~ may eat?
these ones ~
~ this
but ~
he was saying
testing
him,
~ he himself
for ~
knew
what
he was about
to do.
answered
him
-
Philip,
of two hundred
denarii
loaves
~ not ~
are ~ enough
for them
that
each one
a little
something
may take.
says
to him
one
of
the
disciples
of him,
Andrew
the
brother
of Simon
Peter,
there is
a young boy
here
who
has
five
*barley ~ loaves
*
and
two
fish;
but
these
what
are
to
so many?
said
-
Jesus,
make
the
men
to recline.
~ there was
now ~
~ grass
much ~
in
the
place.
reclined
therefore
the
men,
the
number
about
five thousand.
~ took
therefore
the
loaves
-
Jesus
and
having given thanks
he distributed
to the ones
reclining,
likewise
also
of
the
fish
as much as
they were wanting.
~ when
now
they were filled,
he tells
the
disciples
of him,
gather
the
leftover
fragments,
that
*nothing
*
may be lost.
they gathered
therefore
and
they filled
twelve
baskets
of fragments
from
the
five
loaves
-
of barley
which
were leftover
by the ones
having eaten.
~ the
therefore
men
having seen
what
he did
sign
were saying,
-
this one
is
truly
the
prophet,
the one
coming
into
the
world.
Jesus
therefore
having known
that
they are about
to come
and
to seize
him
that
they might make [him]
a king,
departed
again
to
the
mountain
himself
alone.
~ as
and ~
evening
came
went down
the
disciples
of him,
to
the
sea,
and
having embarked
into
a boat
they were going
across
the
sea,
to
Capernaum.
and
darkness
already
had come
and
not yet
had come
to
them
-
Jesus.
~ the
and
sea,
[as] ~ a wind
great
blew,
was being roused.
having rowed
therefore
about
stadia
*twenty five
*
or
thirty
they see
-
Jesus
walking
on
the
sea,
and
near
the
boat
coming,
and
they were afraid.
he
but ~
says
to them,
I
AM
not
do be afraid.
they were willing
therefore
to take
him
into
the
boat,
and
immediately
came
the
boat
at
the
land
to
which
they were going.
on the
next day
the
crowd
-
having stood
across
the
sea
saw
that
~ boat
another
*was not
*
there
*except
*
one
and
that
~ not ~
did come with
the
disciples
of him,
-
Jesus
in
the
boat
but
only
the
disciples
of him
departed.
other
~ came
boats
from
Tiberias
near
the
place
where
they ate
the
bread
[after] having given thanks
the
lord.
when
therefore
saw
the
crowd
that
Jesus
*is not
*
there
nor
the
disciples
of him,
*they ~ embarked
*
into
the
boats
and

to
Capernaum

Jesus.
and
having found
him
across
the
sea
they said
to him,
rabbi,
when
~ here?
did you come ~
answered
them
-
Jesus
and
said,
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
you are seeking
me
not
because
you saw
signs,
but
because
you ate
of
the
loaves
and
were satisfied.

this one

they said
therefore
to
him,
what
may we do
that
we may work
the
works
-
of god?
answered
-
Jesus
and
said,
to them,
this
is
the
work
-
of god,
that
you may believe

[him] whom
~ sent.

they said
therefore
to him,
what
then

you?
what
do you perform?
the

of us

manna
ate
in
the
wilderness,
as
it has
been written,

from

to eat.
said,
therefore
to them,
-
Jesus,
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
not
Moses

the

true.
*for ~ the
*
bread
-
of god
is
the one
coming down
out of
-
heaven
and
life
giving
to the
world.
they said
therefore
to
him,
lord,
always
give
us
-
bread.
this ~ 
said
to them
-
Jesus,
I
am
the
bread

of life;
the one
coming
to
me
* never
*

and
the one
believing
in
me

I told
you
that

all
which
gives

the
father
to
me
will come,
and
the one
coming
to
me
* never

will I throw
out,

I have come down
from
-
heaven
not
that
I may do
the
will
-
of me
but
the
will
of the one

me.
this
now ~
is
the

of the one

me,
that

which
he has given
me
~ not ~
I should ~ lose
of
it,

I will raise up
it,

~ this
for

on

were murmuring
therefore
the
Jews
about
him
because
he said,
I
am
the
bread
-
having come down
out of
-
heaven,
and
they were saying,
not
this man
is
Jesus
the
son
of Joseph,
of whom
we
know
the
father
and
the
mother?
how
now
does he say,
-
out of
-
heaven
I have come down?
answered
Jesus
and
said
to them,
*do not grumble
*
among
yourselves.
no one
is able
to come
to
me
*unless
*
the
father

me

the

this one
is
the

out of

I

were arguing
therefore
with
one another
the
Jews
saying,
how
is able
this man
us
to give ~
the

of him
to eat?
said
therefore
to them,
-

to you,

[so] also
the one

even that one
will live

this one
is
the

out of

not
as
ate
the

and

the one
feeding on
this

these things
he said
in
a synagogue
[while] teaching
in
Capernaum.

in

that

to them,

from
this [time]

said
therefore
-

them

Jesus,

after

*now ~ was
*

said
then
to
him
the

of him,

not even
for
the

says
therefore
to them
-

he
remained
in

*
went up
the
brothers

to
the
feast,
then
also
he
went up
not

as
in

the
then ~ 
Jews
were seeking
him
in
the
feast
and
were saying,
where
is
that man?
and
murmuring
about
him
there was
much
among
the
crowds.
-
some
were saying,
that
a good man,
he is ~
others
but ~ 
were saying,
no,
but
he deceives
the

no one
however

was speaking
about
him
because
the
fear
of the
Jews.
~ while

the
feast
[was] being in the middle
went up
Jesus
into
the
temple
and
was teaching.
were marveling
therefore
the
Jews
saying,
how
this man
letters
has known,

answered
therefore
them
-
Jesus
and
said,
-
my
teaching
*is not
*
mine
but
of the one
having sent
me.
if
anyone
wants
the
will
of him,
to do,
he will know
about
the
teaching
whether
of

Moses
given
you
the

and
none

the
law.
why
me
are you seeking
to kill?
answered
the
crowd,
a demon.
you have
who
you
is seeking
to kill?
answered
Jesus
and
said
to them,
one
work
I did
and
everyone
marvels.
because of
this
Moses
has given
you
-
circumcision -
not
that
of
-
Moses
it is
but
of
the
fathers -
and
on
a sabbath
you circumcise
a man.
if
circumcision

a man

were saying,
therefore
some
of
the ones
of Jerusalem,
not
this man
is it
whom
they are seeking
to kil?
and
look
*he speaks ~ openly
*
and
nothing
to him
they say.
perhaps
truly
knew
the
rulers
that
this man
is
the
Chirst?
but
this man
we know
from where
he is,
~ the
but ~
Chirst
whenever

no one
knows
from where
he is.
cried out
therefore
in
the
temple
[while] teaching
-
Jesus
and
saying,
both me
you know
and
you know
from where
I am.
and
from
myself
* not
I have ~ come,

he is

me,

I

him,

from
him,
I am.
and that one
me

they were seeking
therefore
~ him,
to arrest ~
and
no one
laid
on
him,
the (a)
hand,
because
not yet
had come
the
hour
of him.
from
the
crowd
however,
many
believed
in
him
and
were saying,
the
Christ
whenever
he comes
[surely] not
more
signs
will he do
[than the] things which
this man
did?
heard
the
Pharisees
the
crowd
murmuring
about
him
these things,
and
sent
the
chief priests
and
the
Pharisees
servants
that
they might arrest
him.
said
therefore
-
Jesus,
yet
~ time
a little ~
with
you
I am.
and
I go away
to
the one
having sent
me.
you will seek
me.
and
not
find
me,
and
where
~ am,
I ~
you
not

to come.
said
therefore
the
Jews
to
themselves,
where
this man
is about
to journey
that
we
not
*will ~ find
him?
[surely] not
to
the
dispersion
of the
Greeks
he is about
to jorurney
and
to teach
the
Greeks?
what
is
-
~ word
this ~
which
he said,
you will seek
me
and
*will not find
*
me,
and
where

I
you
*are not able

to come?
~ on
now ~
the
last
day,
the
great [day]
of the
feast,
had stood
-
Jesus
and
cried out
saying,
if
anyone
thirsts
let him come
to
me
and
drink.
the one
believing
in
me,
as
said
the
scripture,
rivers
out of
the
belly
of him

~ this
but ~
he said
about
the
spirit
which
were about
to receive
the ones
having believed
in
him,
not yet
for
was
[the] spirit,
because
Jesus
not yet
was glorified.
[some] of
the
crowd
therefore
having heard
-
~ words
these ~
were saying,
this man
is
truly
the
prophet.
others
were saying,
this man
is
the
Christ;
[some] men
but ~
were saying,
[surely] not
for ~
from
-
Galilee
the
Christ;

[has] not
the
scripture
said
that
from
the
seed
of David
and
from
Bethlehim,
the
village
where
was,
David ~
comes
the
Christ?
a division
therefore
occurred
among
the
crowd
because of
him.
*and ~ some
*
were wanting
of
them
to arrest
him,
but
no one
laid
on
him
the (his)
hands.
came
then
the
servants
to
the
chief priests
and
Pharisees,
and
said
to them
those ones,

* why

him?
answered
the
servants,
never

answered
therefore
them
the
Pharisees,
[surely] not
also
you
have been deceived?
[surely] not
any
of
the
rulers
believed
in
him,
or
of
the
Pharisees?
but

*this ~ crowd

says
Nicodemus
to
them,

and

and
they went

to
the
house

Jesus

went
to

the

the

in

having stood
her
in

to him,
teacher,
this
-
woman
has been caught
in
the act of
committing adultery;
in
now
the
law
to us
Moses
commanded
-
such women

therefore
what

this
but
they were saying
testing
him,
that
they might have [something]
to accuse
him.
-
but
Jesus
down
having stooped
with his
finger
was writing
in
the
ground.
as
but
they were remaining
questioning
him,
he stood up
and
said
to them,
the one
without sin
of (among) you
first
at
her
let him throw
a stone.
and
again
having stooped down
he was writing
in
the
ground.
the ones
and
having heard
were departing
one
by
one
having begun
from
the
older ones,
and
he was left
alone
and
the
woman
in
[the] midst

having stood up
and
-
Jesus
said
to her,
woman,
where
are [they]?
no one
you
condemn
she
and
said,
no one,
lord,
said
and
-
Jesus,
neither [do]
I
you

and
from
the
now [on]
no longer
sin.
again
then
to them,
spoke
-
Jesus
saying,
I
am
the
light
of the
world;
the one
following
me
*will never
*
walk
in
the
darkness,
but
will have
the
light

of life.
said
therefore
to him
the
Pharisees,
you
about
yourself

the
testimony
of you
not
is
true.
answered
Jesus
and
said
to them,
even if
I
testify
about
myself,
\\"\\"true\\"\\
is
the
testimony
of me,
because
I know
from where
I came
and
where
I go.
you
but
not
do know
from where
I come
or
where
I go.
you
according to
the
flesh
judge,
I
not
do judge
anyone.
even
if
judge
but
I,
the
judgment
-
of me,
true,
is
because
alone
not
I am
but
I
and
the one
having sent
me,
[the] father.
even
in
-

and
-
your
it has been written
that
of two
men
the
testimony
\\"\\"true\\"\\
is
I
am
the one
testifying
about
myself
and
testifies
about
me
the one
having sent
me,
[the] father.
they were saying
therefore
to him,
where
is
the
father
of you?
answered
Jesus,
neither
me
you know
nor
the
father
of me;
if
me
you had known
also
the
father
of me
would have
you known
these
-
words
he spoke
in
the
treasury
[while] teaching
in
the
temple;
and
no one
arrested
him,
because
not yet
had come
the
hour
of him.
he said
therefore
again
to them,
I
go way
and
you will seek
me,
and
in
the
sin
of you
you will die
where
I
go away
you
not
are able
to come.
were saying
therefore
the
Jews,
*[surely]  not
he will kill
himself,
because
he says,
where
I
go away
you
not
are able
to come?
and
he says
to them,
you
of
the
things below
are,
I
of
the
things above
am.
you
of
this
-
world
are,
I
not
am
of
this
world
*
I said
therefore
to you
that
you will die
in
the
sins
of you
if
for
not
you do believe
that
I
am [he],
you will die
in
the
sins
of you.
they were saying
thereofore
to him,
you
who
are?
said
to them,
-
Jesus,
[at] the
beginning
* what
*
also
I speak
to you?
many things
I have
about
you
to speak
and
to judge,
but
the one
having sent
me
\\"\\"true\\"\\
is
and I
what
I heard
from
him
these things
I speak
in
the
world.
not
they did know
that
of the
father
to them
he was speaking
said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus,
when
you lift up
the
son
-
of man,
then
you will know
that
I
am [he],
and
from
myself
I do
nothing,
but
as
taught
me
the
father
these things
I speak.
and
the one
having sent
me
with
me
is.
not
he did leave
me
alone,
because
I
the things
pleasing
to him
do
always.
these things
[as] he
is (was) saying,
many
believed
in
him.
was saying
therefore
-
Jesus
to
the
having believed
in him
Jews,
if
you
remain
in
the
word
-
of me,
truly
disciples
of me,
you are
and
you will know
the
truth,
and
the

to
him,
[the]seed
of Abraham
we are
and
to no one

ever
*how
you
do  say,
-
free men
you will become?
answered
them
-
Jesus,
truly,
truly
I say
to you
that
*everyone

sin
a slave
is
-
of sin.
the

if
therefore
the

you
frees
really
free men
you will be.
I know
that

of Aabraham
you are,

you seek
me
to kill

the things
I

and
you
therefore
the things

they answered
and
said
to him,
the
father
of us
Abraham.
is
says
to them
-
Jesus,
if
children
-
of Abraham
you are
the
works
-
of Abraham
you would have been doing.
but
now
you are seeking
me
to kill
a man
who
the
truth
you
has told
which
I heard
from
-
god.
this
Abraham
not
did do
you
are doing
the
works
of the
father
of you.
said
therefore
to him,
we
of
fornication
not

we have,

god
said
to them
-
Jesus,
if
-
god
[the] father
of you

me,
I
for
from
-
god
came forth
and
I come
not

I have come,
but
that one

*why
*
the
speech

of me
not

because
not

of me.
you
of

that one
a manslayer
was
from
[the] beginning
and
in
the
truth
not
has stood
because
not
is
truth
in
him.
when
he speaks
the
lie,
of
the (his)

he speaks,
because
a liar
he is
and
the

of it.
I
but
because
the

speak,
not

who
among

me
concerning

*
you

the one

*therefore
*
you
not

not.
you are
answered
the
Jews
and
said
to him,
not
rightly
say
[did] we
that
a Samaritan
are
you
and
a demon?
you have
answered
Jesus,
I
demon
not
do have
but
I honor
the
father
of me,
and
you
dishonor
me.
I
but
not
do seek
the
glory
of me.
there is
the one
seeking
and
judging.
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
if
anyone
-
my
word

said
therefore
to him
the
Jews,
now
we have known
that
a demon.
you have
Abraham
died
and
the
prophets,
and
you
say,
if
anyone
the
word
of me
keeps,
* never
*
he will ~ taste
death
into
the
age,
[surely]not
you
*are ~ greater
*
[than] the
father
of us,
Abraham,
who
died?
and
the
prophets
died;
whom
yourself?
do make
answered
Jesus,
if
I
glorify
myself,
the
glory
of me
nothing
is
is
the
father
of me
the one
glorifying
me,
whom
you
say,
that
god
of us
he is.
and
not
you have know
him,
I
but
have known
him.
even if
I say
that
not
I have know
him,
I will be
like
you,
a liar.
but
I know
him
and
the
word
of him
I keep.
Abraham,
the
father
of you
was glad
that
he could see
the
day
-
of me,
and
he saw [it]
and
rejoiced.
said
therefore
the
Jews
to
him,
fifty
years
not yet
you possess
and
Abraham
you have seen?
said
to them
Jesus,
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
before
Abraham
came into being
I
am.
they took up
then
stones
that
they might throw
at
him,
Jesus
but
was hidden
and
departed
out of
the
temple.
and
passing along
he saw
a man
blind
from
birth.
and
asked
him
the
disciples
of him
saying,
rabbi,
who
sinned,
this man
or
the
parents
of him,
that
blind
he was born
answered
Jesus,
neither
this man
sinned,
nor
the
parents
of him,
but
that
may be manifested
the
works
-
of god
in
him.
for us
it is necessary
to work
the
works
of the one
having sent
me
while
day
it is
comes
night
when
no one
is able
to work.
when
in
the
world
I am,
light
I am,
of the
world.
these things
having said,
he spat
of the ground
and
he made
clay
out of
the
spittle,
and
he put (anointed)
his
the
clay
on
-
eyes,
and
said
to him,
go
to wash
in
the
pool
-
of Siloam
*(which
is translated
having been sent).
he went
therefore
and
washed
and
came
seeing.
the
therefore
neighbors
and
the ones
seeing
him
*formerly
*
that
a beggar
he was
were saying,
not
*is ~ this man
is
the one
sitting
and
begging?
some
were saying,
-
this
is he,
others
were saying,
no,
but
like
him
he is.
that one
was saying,
-
I
am [he].
they were saying
therefore
to him,
how,
then,
were opened
your
-
eyes?
answered
that man,
the
man,
the one
being called
Jesus,
clay
made
and
anointed
my
-
eyes
and
said
to me,
-
go
to
-
Siloam
and
wash.
having gone
therefore
and
having washed
I saw.
and
they said
to him,
where
is
that one?
he says,
not
I do know
they lead
him
to
the
Pharisees,
the
once
blind man.
it was
now
a sabbath
during
which
day
the
clay
made
-
Jesus,
and
opened
his
-
eyes.
again
then
were asking
him
also
the
Pharisees,
how
he saw.
he saw.
and
he said
to them,
clay
he placed
my
on
-
eyes,
and
I washed,
and
I see.
were saying
therefore
of
the
Pharisees
some
not
is
this
from
god
-
man,
because
the
sabbath
not
he does keep
others
but
were saying,
how
is able
a man [who is]
a sinner
such
signs
to do?
and
a division
was
among
them.
they say
therefore
to them,
blind man
again,
what
you
do ~ say
about
him,
because
he opened
your
-
eyes?
-
and
he said
-
a prophet
he is
not
did believe
therefore
the
Jews
about
him
that
he was
blind
and
saw
*until
*
they called
the
parents
of him,
the one
having seen,
and
asked
them
saying,
this
is
the
son
of you,
whom
you
say
that
blind
he was born?
how
therefore
does he see
now?
answered
therefore
the
parents
of him
and
said,
we know
that
this man
is
the
son
of us
and
that
blind
he was born
how
but
now
he sees
not
we do know
or
who
opened
his
-
eyes
we
not
do know
him
ask
of age
he is
he
about
himself
will speak.
these things
said
the
parents
of him
because
they were fearing
the
Jews,
already
for
had agreed
the
Jews
that
if
anyone
him
confessed
[the] Christ,
* put away from [the] synagogue.
* he would be ~
* therefore
*
the
parents
of him
said,
-
of age,
he is
*ask ~ him.
*
they called
therefore
the
man
*a second time
*
who
was
blind
and
said
to him,
give
glory
-
to god,
we
know
that
this
-
man
a sinner.
is ~
answered
therefore
that man,
if
a sinner
he is
not
I do know
one thing
I know
that
blind
being
now
I see.
they said
therefore
to him,
what
did he do
to you?
how
did he open
your
-
eyes?
he answered
them,
I told
you
already
and
not
you did listen
why
again
do you want
to hear [it]?
[surely] not
also
you
want
his
disciples
to become?
and
they reviled
him
and
said,
you
a disciple
are
of that man,
we
but
-
of Moses
are
disciples.
we
know
that
to Moses
has spoken
-
god,
this man
but
not
we do know
from where
he is.
answered
the
man
and
said
to them,
in
this
for
the
marvelous
is,
that
you
not
do know
from where
he is,
and
he opened
my
-
eyes.
we know
that
sinners
-
god
not
does listen to
but
if
anyone
god fearing
is
and
the
will
of him
does
this man
he hears.
from
the
age
not
it was heard
that
opened
anyone
[the] eyes
of a blind man
having been born [thus],
if
not
was
this man
from
god,
~ not ~
he would ~ be able
to do
anything.
they answered
and
said
to him,
in
sins
you
were born
totally
and
you
teach
us?
and
they threw
him
out.
heard
Jesus
that
they threw
him
out
and
having found
him
said,
*do you believe
*
in
the
son
-
of man?
answered
that man
and
said,
and
who
is he,
sir,
that
I may believe
in
him?
said
to him
-
Jesus,
both
you have seen
him
and
the one
speaking
with
you
that one.
is ~
-
*and ~ he said,
*
I believe,
lord;
and
he worshiped
him.
and
said
-
Jesus,
for
judgment
I
into
-
world
this
came,
that
the ones
not
seeing
may see
and
the
ones seeing
~ blind.
may become ~
heard
[some] of
the
Pharisees
these things
the ones
with
him
being
and
they said
to him,
[surely] not
also
we
*are ~ blind?
*
said
to them
-
Jesus,
if
blind ones
you were,
not
would
you have
sin;
~ now [since]
but
you say,
-
we see,
the
sin;
of you
remains.
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
the one
not
entering
through
the
door
into
the
fold
of the
sheep
but
going up
another way
that one
a thief
is
and
a  robber.
the one
but
entering
through
the
doorkeeper
a shepherd
is
of the
sheep.
to this one
the
doorkeeper
opens,
and
the
sheep
the
voice
of him
hear
and
and
his own
sheep
he calls
by
name
and
leads out
them.
when
when
his own
all
he puts forth,
beofore
them
he goes,
and
the
sheep
him
follow
because
they know
the
voice
of him;
a stranger
but
*never
*
they will follow
but
will flee
from
him,
because
not
they do know
-
of strangers
the
voice.
this
-
similitude
told
them
-
Jesus,
those men
but
not
did understand
what things
they were
which
he was speaking
to them.
said
therefore
again
-
Jesus,
truly,
truly
I say
to you
that
I
am
the
door
of the
sheep.
all
who
came
before
me
theives
are
and
robbers;
but
not
did listen to
them
the
sheep.
I
am
the
door;
through
me
if
anyone
enters
he will be saved
and
will go in
and
will go out
and
pasture
will find
the
thief
not
does come
*except
*
in order that
he may steal
and
kill
and
destroy.
I
came
that
life
thay may have
and [that]
abundantly
may have
I
am
the
shepherd,
the
good one.
the
shepherd,
the
good one,
the
life
of him
lays down
for
the
sheep.
the
hired man
also
not
being
a shepherd,
of whom
(are) not
is
the
sheep
his own,
sees
the
wolf
coming
and
leaves
the
sheep
and
flees -
and
the
wolf
seizes
them
and
scatters [them] -
because
a hired man
he is
and
not
it does matter
to him
about
the
sheep.
I
am
the
shepherd,
the
good one,
and
I know
-
mine
and
know
me
-
mine.
just as
knows
me
the
father
and I
know
the
father,
[so] also
the
life
of me
I lay down
for
the
sheep.
and
other
sheep
I have
which
not
are
of

fold
this
those also
it is necessary [for]
me
to bring,
and
the
voice
of me
they will hear,
and
they will become
one
flock, [with]
one
shepherd.
*therefore
*
me
the
father
loves
because
I
lay down
the
life
of me,
that
again
I may take
it.
no one
takes
it
from
me,
but
I
lay down
it
from
myself.
authority
I have
to lay down
it,
and
authority
I have
again
to receive
it;
this
-
command
I received
from
the
father
of me.
a division
again
there was
among
the
Jews
because of
-
words
these
were saying
and
many
of
them,
a demon
he has
and
he is mad.
why
to him
do you listen
others
said,
these
-
words
not
are
of one being demon possessed.
[surely] not
a demon
is able
of a blind man
eyes
to open?
there was
then
the
[feast of] dedication
among
the ones
in Jerusalem.
winter
it was
and
was walking around
-
Jesus
in
the
temple
on
the
porch
-
of Solomon.
encircled
then
him
the
Jews
and
were saying
to him,
until
when
the
soul
of us
hold [in suspense]?
if
you
are
the
Chirst,
tell
us
openly.
answered
them,
-
Jesus,
I told
you
and
you
do not believe.
the
works
which
I
do
in
the
name
of the
father
of me
these
testify
about
me,
but
you
not
do believe
because
not
you are
of
the
sheep
-
of me.
the
sheep
-
of me
the
voice
of me
hear,
and I
know
them
and
they follow
me,
and I
give
to them
eternal ~ life

and
*never

they will perish
into
the
age,
and
not
will snatch

the
father
of me
that which
has given
me
all
greater than
is,
and
no one
is able
to snatch
out of
the
hand
of the
father.
I
and
the
father
one
are
took up
again
stones
the
Jews
that
they might stone
him.
answered
them
-
Jesus,
many
works
good
I showed
you
from
the
father;
because of
which
of them
work
me
do you stone
answered
him
the
Jews,
for
a good
work
not
we do stone
you
but
for
blasphemy,
and
because
you
a man
being
make
yourself
god.
answered
them
-
Jesus,
~ not
has it ~
been written
in
the
law
of you,
-
I
said,
*you are ~ gods?
*
if
those ones
he called
gods,
to
whom
the
word
-
of god
came -
and
not
is able
to be abolished
the
scripture -
[of] him whom
the
father
sanctified
and
sent
into
the
world
you
do say
that
he blasphemes,
because
I said,
son
-
of god
I am?
if
not
I do perform
the
works
of the
father
of me,
not
do believe
me,
it
but
I do,
even if
me,
you
do not believe,
the
works
believe,
that
you may know
and
may continue to know
that
in
me
the
father [is]
and I
in
the
father.
they were seeking
therefore
him
again
to seize,
and
he went out
from
the
hand
of them.
and
he went away
again
across
the
Jordan
to
the
place
where
was
John
John
at first
baptizing
and
he remained
there.
and
many
came
to
him
and
were saying,
-
John
indeed
sign
did
no,
everything
but
whichever
said
John
about
this man
\\"\\"true\\"\\
was
and
many
believed
in
him
there.
there was
now
a certain one
being sick,
Lazarus
from
Bethany,
of
the
village
of Mary
and
Martha
the
sister
of her.
it was
now
Mary
the one
having anointed
the
lord
with ointment
and
having wiped
the
feet
of him
with the
hairs
of her,
whose
-
brother
Lazarus
was sick.
sent
therefore
the
sisters
to
him
saying,
lord,
look,
the one whom
you are fond of
is sick.
having heard (this)
and
-
Jesus
said,
this
-
sickness
not
is
to
death
but
for
the
glory
-
of god,
that
may be glorified
the
son
-
of god,
through
it.
loved
now
-
Jesus
-
Martha
and
the
sister
of her
and
-
Lazarus.
when
therefore
he heard
that
he is sick,
then
-
he remained
in
which
he was
[the] place
two
days.
then
after
this
he says
to the
disciples,
let us go
into
-
Judea
again.
say
to him
the
disciples,
rabbi,
[just] now
were seeking
you
to stone
the
Jews,
and
again
you go
there?
answered
Jesus,
not
twelve
hours
are there
of the
day?
if
anyone
walks around
in
the
day,
not
he does stumble
because
the
light
-
of world
this
he sees.
if
but
anyone
walks around
during
the
night,
he stumbles,
because
the
light
not
is
in
him.
these things
he said,
and
after
this
he says
to them
Lazarus,
the
friend
of us
has fallen asleep,
but
I am going
that
I may awaken
him.
said
therefore
the
disciples,
to him,
lord,
if
he has fallen asleep,
he will be healed.
had spoken
but
-
Jesus
about
the
death
of him,
those men
but
supposed
that
about
the
rest
-
of sleep
he speaks.
then
therefore
told
them
-
Jesus
plainly,
Lazarus
died,
and
I rejoice
because of
you
that
you may believe,
that
not
I was
there;
but
let us go
to
him.
said
therefore
Thomas,
the one
being called
Didymus,
to the
fellow disciples,
let us go
also
we
that
may die
with
him.
having come
therefore
-
Jesus
found
him
four
already
days
having [been]
in
the
tomb.
was
now
-
Bethany
near
-
Jerusalem
about
away
stadia
fifteen.
many
and
of
the
Jews
had come
to
-
Martha
and
Mary
that
they might console
them
about
the (their)
brother.
-
therefore
Martha
when
she heard
that
Jesus
comes
met
him;
Mary
but
in
the
house
was sitting.
said
therefore
-
Martha
Martha
-
Jesus,
lord,
if
you were
here
not
would
have died
the
brother
of me;
but
even
now
I know
that
*whatever
*
you ask
-
god
will give
you
-
god.
says
to her
-
Jesus,
will rise again
the
brother
of you.
says
to him
-
Martha,
I know
that
he will rise
in
the
resurrection
on
the
last
day.
said
to her
-
Jesus,
I
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life;
the one
believing
in
me
even if
he should die
will live,
and
*everyone
*
living
and
believing
in
me
*never dies

*
into
the
age.

to
Jerusalem

themselves.
they were seeking
therefore

Jesus
and
were speaking

then
Jesus
before

came
into
Bethany,
where
was
Lazarus

raised

they made
then
him
a supper
there,

this
not

because
a thief
he was

but
the
chief priests
that
also
-
Lazarus
they might kill,

many
on account of
him
were going away
of the
Jews
and
were believing
in

Jesus.
on the
next day
the
crowd

the one
having come
to
the
feast,
having heard
that
is coming

Jesus
to
Jerusalem,
took
the
branches
of the
Palm Trees

went out
to
a meeting
with him

were crying out,

on

when

then
they remembered
that
these things

with respect to
him

these things
they did
to him.

therefore
the
crowd,

being
with
him
when

Lazarus
he called
out of
the
tomb

raised
him
from

there were
now
Greeks
some

therefore
approached
Philip

from
Bethsaida

were asking
him

Philip

and
Jesus
answers
them
saying,
has come

that

I say
to you,

the

crowd,
the one
having stood
and
having heard,
were saying,
thunder

were saying,

this
and
he was saying
signifying
by what kind of
death
he was about
to die.
answered
then
him
the
crowd,
we
heard
from
the
law
that
the
Christ

into

how

do you
that

to be lifted up

these things
spoke
Jesus,
and
having gone away,
he was hidden
from
them.

not
they were believing
in
him,
that
the
word
of Isaiah
the
prophet
may be fulfilled
which
said,
lord,
who
believed
the
report
of us?
and
the
arm
of [the] lord
to whom
was [it] revealed?
*therefore
*
not
they were able
to believe,
because
again
said
Isaiah,
he has blined
their

hardened
their

heart,
that
not
they might see
with the
eyes
and
understand
with the

I will cure

these things
spoke
Isaiah
because
he saw
the
glory
of him,
and
he spoke
about
him.
nevertheless
however
even
of
the
rulers
many
believed
In
him,
but
because of
the
Pharisees
not
they were confessing

they loved
for
the

of men

than

of god.
Jesus

cried out
and
said,
the one
believing
in
me
does not
believe
in
me

in
the one
having sent

I

that

the one
setting aside
me

the
words
of me
has
the one
judging
him.
the
word
which
I spoke,
that
will judge
him
on
the
last
day.
because
I
of
myself
did not
speak
but
the one
having sent
me,
*[the] father
he
to me
a command
has given
what
I may say
and
what
I may speak.
and
I know
that
the
command
of him

therefore
I
speak,
as
has spoken
to me
the
father,
so
I speak.
before
now
the
feast
of the
passover,
having known
-
Jesus
that
came
his

hour
that
he should pass
from

world
this
to
the
father,
having loved
-
his own
the one
in
the
world,
to
[the] end
he loved
them.
and
supper
taking place,
the
devil
already
having put
into
the
heart
that
he should betray
him
[of] Judas
[son] of Simon
of Iscariot,
[and Jesus] having known
that
all things
gave
him
the
father,
into
the (his)
hands
and
that
from
god
he came forth
and
to
-
god
is going,
he rises
from
the
supper
and
puts [aside]
his
garments
and
having taken
a towel
he girded
himself.
then
he puts
water
into
the
basin
and
began
to wash
the
feet
of the
disciples
and
to wipe [them]
with the
towel
with which
he had
girded himself
he comes,
then,
to
Simon
Peter.
he says
to him,
lord,
you
my
wash
-
feet?
answered
Jesus
and
said
to him,
what
I
am doing
you
do not
perceive
now,
you will understand
but
after
these things.
says
to him
Peter,
*never
*
will you wash
my
-
feet
into
the
age.
answered
Jesus
him,
*unless
*
I wash
you,
do not
you have
a share
with
me.
says
to him
Simon
Peter,
lord,
not
the
feet
of me
only
but
also
the (my)
hands
and
the (my)
head.
says
to him
-
Jesus,
the one
having been bathed
does not
have
need
*except
*
the (his)
feet
to wash,
but
is
clean
wholly;
and
you
clean
are
but
not
all.
he knew
for
the one
betraying
him;
*therefore
*
he said,
-
not
all
clean
are
when
therefore
he washed
the
feet
of them
and
took
the
garments
of him
and
reclined
again,
he said
to them,
do you know
what
I have done
to you?
you
call
me
the
teacher
and
the
lord,
and
well
you say,
I am
for
if
therefore
I
washed
your
-
feet [being]
the
lord,
and
the
teacher,
also
you
ought
of one another
to wash
the
feet.
an example
for
I gave
you
that
as
I
did
to you
also
you
may do.
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
not
is
a slave
greater [than]
the
lord
of him,
nor
a sent one
greater [than]
the one
having sent
him.
if
these things
you know,
blessed
you are
if
you do
them.
not
about
all
of you
I speak
(I
know
whom
I chose);
but
that
the
scripture
may be fulfilled,
the one
eating
my
-
bread
lifted up
against
me
the
heel
of him,
from
now [on]
I tell
you
before
the
occurrence,
that
you may believe
when
It occurs
that
I
am [he].
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
the one
receiving
*whomever
*
I may send
me

the one
and
me
receiving
receives
the one
having sent
me.
these things
having said,
-
Jesus
was troubled
in the (his)
spirit
and
he testified
and
said,
truly,
truly
I say
to you
that
one
of
you
will betray
me.

therefore
to this one

that one
thus
on

-
Jesus,
that one
it is
to whom
I
will dip
the
morsel
and
will give
to him.
having dipped
therefore
the
morsel
he takes
and
gives
to Judas
[the son] of Simon
of Iscariot.
and
after
the
morsel
then,
entered
into
that man
-
Satan.
says
therefore
to him
-
Jesus,
that which
you do
do
quickly.

no one
knew
of the ones

to him

Jesus,

the things of which

or
to the
poor
that
something
he should give.
having taken
therefore
the
morsel
that man
went out
immediately;
it was
and
night.
when
therefore
he went out,
says
Jesus
now

a little while
with
you
I am;
you will seek

all men

says
to him
Simon
Peter,
lord,
where
do you go?
answered
him
Jesus,
where
I go
are not
you able
me,
now
to follow,
you will follow
but
later.
says
to him
-
Peter,
lord,
*why

not

you
to follow
now?
the

of me
for
you
I will lay down.
answers
Jesus,
the

truly
I say
to you,

 [will] crow

to him
Thomas,

are we able

to him

Jesus,

with
you
I am

Philip?

having seen
me

I [am]
in
the

the
father
in

Judas,

and
what
has occurred
that
to us
you are about

answered
Jesus
and
said
to him,
if
anyone
loves
me
the
word
of me
he will keep
and
the
father
of me
will love
him
and
to

many things
I will speak
with

for
the
of the

and
in

anything.
but
in order that
may know
the
world
that
I love
the
father,
and
as
commanded
me
the
father,
so
I do.
arise,
let us go
from here.
I
am
the
vine,
the
true one,
and
the
father
of me
the
vinedresser
is.
every
branch
in
me
not
bearing

he takes
it,
and
every [branch]
-
fruit

it
that
fruit
much
it may bear.
already
you
clean
are
because of
the
word
which
I have spoken
to you,
remain
in
me,
and I
in
you.
as
the
branch
not
is able
fruit
to bear
from
itself
*unless
*
it remains
on
the
vine,
so
nether
you
*unless
*
in
me
you remain.
I
am
the
vine,
you [are]
the
branches.
the one
remaining
in
me
and i
in
him
this one
bears
fruit
much
because
apart form
me
not
you are able
to do
anythings.
*unless
*
someone
remains
in
me,
he was (is) cast
out
as
the
branch
and
was (is) dried up
and
they gather
them
and
into
the
fire
they throw [them]
and
they are burned.
if
you remain
in
me
and
the
words
of me
in
you
remain,
*whatever
*
you want
ask,
and
it will be done
for you.
by
this
was (is) glorified
the
father
of me,
that
fruit

you bear
and
you be

as
loved
me
the
father,
so I
you
*loved

in
the
love
-
of me.
if
the
commands
of me
you keep,
you will remain
in
the
love
of me,
as
I
the
commands
of the
father
of me
have kept
and
I remain
his
in
-
love.
these things
I have spoken
to you
that
the
joy
-
of me
in
you
may be
and
the
joy
of you
may be made full.
this
is
the
commands
-
of me,
that
you love
one another
as
I loved
you.
greater
than this
love
no one
has
that
someone
the
life
of him
he lay down
for
the
friends
of him.
you
friends
of me
are
if
you do
the things which
I
command
you.
no longer
do I call
you
slaves,
because
the
slave
*does not know
*
what
does
his
-
lord;
you
but
I have called
friends,
becauuse
all things
which
I heard
from
the
father
of me
I made known
to you.
not
you
me
chose
but
I
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
you
go
and
fruit
bear
and
the
fruit
of you
remains
that
*whatever
*
*
you ask
the
father
in
the
name
of me
he may give
to you.
these things
I command
you,
that
you love
one another.
if
the
world
you
hates
know
that
me
before
you
it has hated.
if
of
the
world
you were,
the
world
would
its
own
[have] loved,
because
but
from
the
world
not
you are
but
I
chose
you
out of
the
world,
*therefore
*
hates
you
the
world.
remember
the
saying
which
I
told
you,
not
is
a slave
greater [than]
the
lord
of him.
if
me
they persecuted,
also
you
they will persecute,
if
the
word
of me
they kept,
also
-
yours
they will keep.
but
these
all things
they will do
to
you
on account of
the
name
of me,
because
not
they do know
the one
having sent
me.
if
did not
I come
and
speak
to them,
sin
not
they would have
now
but
a cloak
do not
they have
around
the
sin
of them.
the one
me
hating
also
the
father
of me
hates.
if
the
works
not
I did ~ do
among
them
which
no ~ man
other
did,
sin
not
they would have
now
but
both
they have seen
and
they have hated
both
me
and
the
father
of me.
but
that
may be fulfilled
the
word
-
in
the
law
of them
having been written,
-
they hated
me
without cause.
when
comes
the
encourager
whom
I
will send
to you
from
the
father,
the
spirit
-
of truth,
which
from
the
father
proceeds,
that one
will testify
about
me;
also
you
and
testify,
because
from
[the] beginning
with
me
you are.
these things
I have spoken
to you
that
not 
you be caused to stumble.
away from [the] synagogues
they will put
you;
but
comes
an hour
that
*everyone
*
having killed
you
may suppose
service
to offer
-
to god.
and
these things
they will do
because
did not
they know
the
father
nor
me
but
these things
I have spoken
to you
that
when
comes
the
hour
of them
you might remember
them
that
I
told
you.
these things
but
to you
from
[the] beginning
do not
I say
because
with
you
I was.
now
but
I am going
to
the one
having sent
me,
and
none
of
you
asks
me,
where
are you going?
but
because
these things
I have spoken
to you
-
sorrow
has filled
your
-
heart.
but
I
the
truth
tell
you,
it is better
for you
that
I
go away.
if
for
do not
I go away
the
encourager
* will not come
*
to
you,
if
but
I go,
I will send
him
to
you
and
having come
that one
will expose
the
world
concerning
sin
and
concerning
righteousness
and
concerning
judgment.
concerning
sin,
-
because
do not
they believe
in
me;
concerning
righteousness
-
because
to
the
father
I go,
and
no longer
do you see
me;
concerning
-
judgment,
because
the
ruler
-
world
this
has been judged.
yet
many things
I have
you
to tell
but
you
are not able
to bear [them]
now;
when
but
has come
that one,
the
spirit
-
of truth,
he will guide
you
in
-
truth
every
not
for
will he speak
from
himself,
but
what things
he will hear
he will speak
and
the things
coming
he will announce
to you.
that one
me
will glorify
because
of
-
mine
he will receive
and
will announce [it]
to you.
all things
which
has
the
father
mine
are
*therefore
*
I said
that
of
-
mine
he receives
and
will announce [it]
to you.

and
no longer
you see
me,
and
again
a little [time]
and
you will see
me.
said
therefore
[some] of
the
disciples
of him
to
one another,
what
is
this
which
he says
to us,
a little [time]
and
you
do not see
me,
and
again
a little [time]
and
you will see
me?
and,
because
I go
to
the
father?
they were saying
therefore,
what
is
this
which
he says,
the
little [time]?
*we do not know
*
what
he says.
knew
-
Jesus
that
they were wanting
him
to ask
and
he said
to them,
about
this
you inquire
with
one another,
that
I said,
a little [time]
and
you
do not see
me,
and
again
a little [time]
and
you will see
me?
truly,
truly
I say
to you
that
will weep
and
will mourn
you,
the
but
world
will rejoice
you
will be grieved,
but
the
grief
of you
into
joy
will become.
the
woman
when
she gives birth
grief
has
because
has come
the
hour
of her;
when
but
she gives birth to
the
child,
no longer
she remembers
the
affliction
because of
the
joy
that
was born
a man (human)
into
the
world.
and
you
therefore
now
-
grief
have
again
but
I will see
you,
and
will rejoice
your
-
heart,
and
the
joy
of you
no one
takes
from
you.
and
on
that
-
day
me
not
you will ask
anything.
truly,
truly
I say
to you,
*whatever
*
you ask
the
father
in
the
name
of me
he will give [it]
to you.
until
now
you
did not ask
anything
in
the
name
of me;
ask
and
you will receive,
that
the
joy
of you
may be
fulfilled.
these things
in
similitudes
I have spoken
to you;
comes
an hour
when
no longer
in
similitudes
I will speak
to you,
but
plainly
concerning
the
father
I will announce
to you.
on
that
-
day,
in
the
name
of me
you will ask,
and
do not
I say
to you
that
I
will ask
the
father
concerning
you.
himself
for
the
father
is fond of
of you,
because
you
me
have been fond of
and
have believed
that
I
from
-
god
came forth.
I came
from
the
father
and
I have come
into
the
world;
again
I leave
the
world
and
go
to
the
father.
say
the
disciples
of him,
see,
now
in
plainness
you speak
and
similitudes
no longer
do you speak.
now
we know
that
you know
all things
and
no
need
you have
that
anyone
you
question
by
this
we believe
that
from
god
you came forth.
answered
them
Jesus,
now
do you believe?
look,
is coming
an hour
and
has come
that
you are scattered
each one
to
* their
* own
and me
alone
you leave
and
not
I am
alone,
because
the
father
with
me
is.
these things
I have spoken
to you
that
in
me
peace
you may have
in
the
world
affliction
you have
but
be cheerful,
I
have conquered
the
world.
these things
said
Jesus,
and
having lifted up
the
eyes
of him
to
-
heaven
said,
father,
has come
the
hour;
glorify
your

son,
that
the

as
you gave
him

which
you have given
me
that
I should do.
and
now
glorify
me

father,
along with
yourself
with the
glory
which
I was having
before

because
the
words
which
you gave

he questioned
them,

and
they said;

Jesus,

doorkeeper
and
brought in
-
Peter.
says
therefore
-
to Peter

a fire
having been made,
for

it was

they were warming themselves;
was
and
also
-
Peter
with
them
having stood
and
warming himself.
the
then
high priest
questioned
-
Jesus
about
the
disciples
of him
and
about
the
teaching
of him.
answered
him
Jesus,
I
in public [view]
have spoken
to the
world;
I
always
taught
in
a synagogue
and
in
the
temple,
where
all
the
Jews
come together,
and
in
secret
I spoke
nothing.
why
me
do you
question
the ones
having heard
what
I spoke
to them.
look,
these ones
know
what things
said
I
these things
but
he
having said,
one
having stood nearby
of the
servants
gave
a blow
-
to Jesus,
having said,
thus
do you answer
the
high priest?
answered
him
Jesus,
if
badly
I spoke
testify
about
the
bad;
if
but
good,
why
me
do you beat

then
him
-
Annas,
having been bound,
to
Caiaphas,
the
high priest.
was
now
Simon
Peter
having stood
and
warming himself.
they said
therefore
to him,
[surely] not
also
you
of
the
disciples
of him
are?
denied
that one
and
said,
not
I am
says
one
of
the
slaves
of the
high priest,
a relative
being
[of him] of whom
cut off
Peter
the (his)
ear,
did not
I
you
see
in
the
garden
with
him?
again
therefore
denied
Peter,
and
immediately
a cock
crowed.
they led
therefore
-
Jesus
from
-
Caiaphas
to
the
praetorium;
it was
and
early;
and
they
*did not enter
*
into
the
praetorium,
praetorium,
lest
they should be defiled
but
might eat
the
passover.
went forth
therefore
-
Pilate
outside
to
them
and
says,
what
accusation
do you bring
against
-
man
this
they answered
and
said
to him,
* unless
*
was
this man
evil
doing
not
would
to you
we have delivered
him.
said
therefore
to them
-
Pilate,
take
him
you
and
according
to the
law
of you
judge
him.
said
to him
the
Jews,
for us
not
it is lawful
to kill
anyone-
that
the
word
-
of Jesus
may be fulfilled
which
he said
signifying
by what
death
he was about
to die.
entered
therefore
again
into
the
praetorium
-
Pilate
and
called
-
Jesus
and
said
to him,
you
are
the
king
of the
the Jews?
answered
Jesus,
from
yourself
you
this
say
or
others
told
you
about
me?
answered
-
Pilate,
[surely] not
I
a Jew
am
the
nation
-
of you
and
the
high priest
delivered
you
to me.
what
did you do?
answered
Jesus,
the
kingdom
-
of me
not
is
of
-
world
this
if
of
-
world
this
was
the
kingdom
-
of me,
the
servants
-
of me
fought
would have
that
not
I should be delivered
to the
Jews;
now
but
the
kingdom
-
of me
* is not
*
from here.
said
therefore
to him
-
Pilate,
so
a king
are
you?
answered
-
Jesus,
you
say
that
a king
I am
I
for
this
have been born
and
for
this
have come
into
the
world,
that
I might testify
to the
truth;
* everyone
*
being
of
the
truth
hears
my
-
voice.
says
to him
-
Pilate,
what
is
truth?
and
this
having said,
again
he went out
to
the
Jews
and
says
to them,
I
not any
find
in
him
fault.
there is
but
a custom
for you
that
one
I may release
to you
during
the
passover.
do you want
therefore
[that] release
to you
the
king
of the
Jews?
they cried out
therefore
again
saying,
not
this man
but
-
Barabbas.
was
now
-
Barabbas.
a rober.
then
therefore
took
-
Pilate,
-
Jesus
and
had him scourged.
and
the
soldiers
having woven
a wreath
out of
thorns
put [it] on
his
-
head,
and
a garment
purple
threw around
him,
and
they were coming
to
him
and
were saying,
hail,
the
king
of the
Jews;
and
they were giving
him
blows.
and
went forth
again
outside
-
Pilate
and
says
to them,
look,
I bring
to you
him
out,
that
you may know
that
not any
fault
I find
in
him.
came forth
therefore
-
Jesus
outside,
wearing
the
thorny
wreath
and
the
purple
garment.
and
he says
to them,
see
the
man.
when
therefore
saw
him
the
chief priests
and
the
servants
they cried out
saying,
crucify,
crucify,
says
to them
-
Pilate,
take
him
you
and
you crucify,
I
for
not
do find
in
him
fault,
answered
him
the
Jews,
we
a law
have
and
according
to the
law
he ought
to die,
because
[the] son
of god
himself
he made
when
therefore
heard
-
Pilate
this
-
word,
[even] more,
he was afriad
and
he entered
into
the
praetorium
again
and
says
-
to Jesus,
from where
are
you?
-
but
Jesus
an answer
~ not ~
did ~ give
him.
says
therefore
to him
-
Pilate,
to me
do not
you speak
not
do you know
that
authority
I have
to free
you
and
authority
I have
to crucify
you?
answered
him
Jesus,
do not
you have
authority
against
me
at all
* except
*
it had been
given
to you
from above;
* therefore,
*
the one
having delievered
me
to you
greater
sin
has.
from
this [incident]
-
Pilate
began seeking
to free
him;
the
but
Jews
cried out
saying,
if
this man
you free,
not
you are
a friend
-
of Caesar;
everyone
everyone
a king
himself
making
speaks against
-
Caesar.
-
therefore
Pilate
having heard
-
words
these
led
out
-
Jesus
and
he sat
upon
a tribunal
in
a place
being called
[the] pavement,
in Hebrew
but
Gabbatha.
it was
now
[the] preparation [day]
of the
passover,
hour
it was
about
[the] sixth.
and
he says
to the
Jews,
behold
the
king
of you.
cried out
therefore
these ones,
away,
away,
crucify
him.
says
to them
-
Pilate,
the
king
of you
shall I crucify?
answered
the
high priest,
do not
we have
a king
* except
*
Caesar.
then
therefore
he delivered
him
to them
that
he should be crucified.
they took
therefore
-
Jesus,
and
carrying
by himself
the
cross
he went out
to
the [place]
being called
of [the] skull,
[the] place ~
which
is called
in Hebrew
Golgotha,
where
him
they crucified
and
with
him
others
two
on this side
and
on that
in the middle
and
-
Jesus.
wrote
and
also
a title
-
Pilate
and
placed [it]
upon
the
cross,
been
and
it had ~ written
Jesus
the
Nazarine
the
king
of the
Jews.
this
therefore
-
title
many
read
of the
Jews,
because
near
was
the
place
the
city
where
was crucified
-
Jesus,
and
~ been ~
it had ~ written
in Hebrew,
in Latin,
[and] in Greek.
were saying
therefore
-
to Pilate
the
chief priests
of the
Jews,
do not
write
the
king
of the
Jews,
but
that
that one
said,
king
I am
of the
Jews.
answered
-
Pilate,
what
I have written,
I have written.
the
therefore
soldiers
when
they crucified
-
Jesus,
took
the
garments
of him
and
made
four
parts,
to each
soldier
a part,
and
the
tunic.
was
now
the
tunic
seamless,
from
the
top
woven
through
[the] whole.
they said
therefore
to
one another,
not
let us spilt
it,
but
let us cast lots
for
it
of whose
it will be;
that
the
scripture
might be fulfilled
the one
saying,
they divided
the
garments
of me
for themselves
and
for
the
clothing
of me
they threw
lots.
the
-
therefore
soldiers
these things
did
there had stood
but
beside
the
cross
-
of Jesus
the
mother
of him
and
the
sister
of the
mother
of him,
Mary
the [wife]
-
of Clopas,
and
Mary
-
Magdalene.
Jesus
therefore
having seen
the [his]
mother
and
the
disciple
having stood by
whom
he was loving,
says
to the (his)
mother,
woman,
behold
the
son
of you.
then
he says
to the
disciple,
behold
the
mother
of you.
and
from
that
-
hour
took
the
disciple
her
into
the (his)
own [care].
after
this,
having known
-
Jesus
that
already
everything
has been completed,
that
may be fulfilled
the
scripture,
he says,
I thirst.
a vessel
was set
of vinegar;
full
a sponge
then
full
-
of vinegar
~ a hyssop branch
having been wrapped around ~
they brought [it to]
his
-
mouth.
when
therefore
received
the
vinegar
-
Jesus,
he said,
it has been accomplished,
and
having bowed
the (his)
head
he gave up
the (his)
spirit.
the
therefore
Jews,
since
* [the] preparation [day],
* it was ~
that
* not
* may stay
upon
the
cross
the
bodies
during
the
sabbath,
was
for
great
the
day
of that
-
sabbath,
they asked
-
Pilate
that
might be broken
their
-
legs
and
taken away.
came
therefore
the
soldiers
and
of the
-
first man
broke
the
legs
and
of the
other
-
having been crucified with
him;
upon
but
-
Jesus
having come to
when
they saw [that]
already
he
has died,
did not
they break
his
-
legs,
but
one
of the
soldiers
with spear
his
-
side
pierced,
and
out came
immediately
blood
and
water.
and
the one
having seen [this]
has testified,
and
\\"\\"true\\"\\
his
is
-
testimony,
and
that one
knows
that
truly
he speaks,
that
also
you
may believe.
happened
for
these things
that
the
scripture
might be fulfilled,
a bone
not
shall be broken
of him.
and
again
a different
scripture
says,
they will look
at
[him] whom
they pierced.
after
now
these things
asked
-
Pilate
Joseph
-
from
Arimathea,
being
a disciple
-
of Jesus
secretly
but
because of
the
fear
of the
Jews,
that
he might take
the
body
-
of Jesus;
and
allowed [it]
-
Pilate.
he came
therefore
and
took
the
body
of him.
came
and
also
Nicodemus,
the one
having come
to
him
during [the] night
-
[at] first,
bearing
a mixture
of myrrh
and
aloes
about
* one hundred ~ pounds.
*
they took
therefore
the
body
-
of Jesus
and
bound
it
in linen cloths
with
-
spices,
as
~ [the] custom
is
with the
Jews
to bury.
there was
now
in
the
place
where
he was crucified
a garden,
and
in
the
garden
a tomb
new
in
which
never yet
anyone
had
been placed
there
therefore,
because of
the
preparation
of the
Jews,
because
near
was
the
tomb,
they placed
-
Jesus.
on the
now
first [day]
of the
week
Mary
-
Magdalene
comes
early,
dark
still
it being,
to
the
tomb
and
sees
the
stone
having been taken
from
the
tomb.
she runs
therefore
and
comes
to
Simon
Peter
and
to
the
other
disciple
whom
was being fond of
-
Jesus
and
says
to them,
they took
the
lord
from
the
tomb,
and
do not
we know
where
they placed
him.
went forth
therefore
-
Peter
and
the
other
disciple,
and
they were coming
to
the
tomb.
were running
and
the
two
together;
and
the
other
disciple
ran ahead
faster [than]
-
Peter
and
came
first
to
the
tomb,
and
having stooped down
he sees
lying
the
linen clothes,
not
however
he entered.
comes
then
also
Simon
Peter
following
him.
and
he entered
into
the
tomb,
and
he sees
the
linen clothes,
lying,
and
the
face cloth,
which
was
upon
the
head
of him,
not
with
the
linen cloths
lying
but
apart,
having been folded up
in
one
place.
then
therefore
entered
also
the
other
disciple,
the one
having come
first
to
the
tomb,
and
he saw
and
believed,
not yet
for
they knew
the
scripture
that
it is necessary [for]
him
from
[the] dead
to rise up.
went away
then
again
to
their [own places]
the
disciples.
Mary
now
had stood
at
the
tomb
outside
weeping.
as
then
she was weeping,
she stooped
into
the
tomb
and
sees
two
angels
in
white
sitting,
one
at
the
head
and
one
at
the
feet,
where
was lying
the
body
-
of Jesus.
and
say
to her
those ones,
woman,
why
do you weep?
she says
to them,
-
they took
the
lord
of me,
and
do not
I know
where
they placed
him.
these things
having said
she turned
* back around,
*
*
and
she sees
-
Jesus
having stood,
and
did not
know
that
Jesus
it is (was)
says
to her
Jesus,
woman,
why
do you weep?
whom
do you seek?
that one
supposing
that
the
gardener
he is (was)
says
to him,
sir,
if
you
carried away
him,
tell
me
where
you placed
him,
and I
him
will take
says
to her
Jesus,
Mary.
having turned
that woman
says
to him,
in Hebrew,
Rabboni,
(which
means
teacher).
says
to her
Jesus,
stop
me
touching
not yet
for
I have ascended
to
the
father;
go
but
to
the
brothers
of me
and
tell
them,
I ascend
to
the
father
of me
and
father
of you
and
god
of me
and
god
of you.
comes
Mary
-
Magdalene
announcing
to the
disciples,
-
I have seen
the
lord,
and
these things
he said
to her.
being
therefore
early evening
-
day,
that ~
the
first
of the week,
and
the
doors
having been shut
where
were
the
disciples
because of
the
fear
of the
Jews,
came
-
Jesus
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
says
to them,
peace
to you.
and
this
having said
he showed
the (his)
hands
and
the (his)
side
to them.
rejoiced
therefore
the
disciples
[at] having seen
the
lord.
said
therefore
to them
-
Jesus
again,
peace
to you.
as
has sent
me
the
father,
[so] also I
send
you
and
this
having said
he breathed on [them]
and
says
to them,
receive
spirit
the holy
the holy
of whomever
you forgive
the
sins
they have been forgiven
to them;
* of whomever
*
you hold
they have been held.
Thomas
but
one
of
the
twelve,
the one
being called
Didymus,
not
was
with
them
when
came
Jesus.
were saying
therefore
to him
the
other
disciples,
we have seen
the
lord.
he
but
said
to them,
* unless
*
I see
in
the
hands
of him
the
mark
of the
nails
and
I put
the
finger
of me
into
the
place
of the
nails
and
I put
my
-
hand
into
the
side
of him,
never
never
I will believe
and
after
days
eight
again
were
inside
the
disciples
of him
and
Thomas
with
them.
comes
-
Jesus
- the
doors
having been shut-
and
stood
in
the
midst
and
said,
peace
to you.
then
he says
-
to Thomas,
bring
the
finger
of you
here
and
see
the
hands
of me,
and
bring
the
hand
of you
and
put [it]
into
the
side
of me,
and
do not
become
faithless
but
faithful.
answered
Thomas
and
said
to him,
the
lord
of me
and
the
god
of me.
says
to him
-
Jesus,
because
you have seen
me
have you believed?
blessed [are]
the ones
not
having seen
and
having believed.
many
-
therefore
also
other
signs
did
-
Jesus
before
the
disciples
of him,
which
not
have
been written
in
-
book
this
these things
but
have been written
that
you might believe
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ,
the
son
of
god,
and
that
believing,
life
you may have
in
the
name
of him.
after
these things
manifested
himself
again
-
Jesus
to the
disciples
at
the
sea
-
of Tiberias;
he was manifested
now
thus.
there were
together
Simon
Peter
and
Thomas
the one
being called
Didymus
and
Nathanael
the one
from
Cana
-
of Galilee
and
the [sons]
-
of Zebedee
and
others
of
the
disciples
of him
two.
says
to them
Simon
Peter,
I am going
to fish.
they say
to him,
are coming
also
we
with
you.
they went forth
and
embarked
into
the
boat,
and
during
that
-
night
they caught
nothing.
early morning
now
already
having come,
stood
Jesus
on
the
shore;
not
however
had realized
the
disciples
that
Jesus.
it is (was)
says
therefore
to them
-
Jesus,
children,
[surely] not
any
fish
you have?
they answered
him,
no.
no.
and
he said
to them,
throw
to
the
right
side
of the
boat,
the
net,
and
you will find [fish].
they threw [it]
therefore,
and
no longer
it
to draw
were they strong [enough]
from
the
multitude
of the
fish.
says
therefore
-
disciple
that
whom
was loving
-
Jesus
-
to Peter,
the
lord
it is.
Simon
therefore
Peter,
having heard
that
the
lord
it is,
the
outer garment
tied around himself,
he was
for
unclothed,
and
threw
himself
into
the
sea.
the
but
other
disciples
in the
boat
came,
not
for
they were
far
from
the
land
but
about
from
~ cubits,
two hundred
dragging
the
net
of the
fish.
when
therefore
they disembarked
onto
the
land
they see
a charcoal fire
lying
and
fish
lying upon [it]
and
bread.
says
to them
-
Jesus,
bring
from
the
fish
which
you caught
now.
went up
therefore
Simon
Peter
and
dragged
the
net
onto
the
land
full of
fish
large
a hundred [and]
fifty
three
and [though]
so many
being
did not
split
the
net.
says
to them
-
Jesus,
come
eat breakfast.
not one
now
was daring
of the
disciples
to ask
him,
you
who
are?
having known
that
the
lord
it is.
comes
Jesus
and
takes
the
bread
and
gives
to them,
and
the
fish
likewise.
this [was]
now
[the] third [time]
was manifested
Jesus
to the
disciples
having been raised
from
[the] dead.
when
then
they ate
says
-
to Simon
Peter
-
Jesus,
Simoon
[son] of John,
do you love
me
more [than]
these ones?
he says
to him,
yes,
lord,
you
know
that
I am fond of
you.
he says
to him,
feed
the
lambs
of me.
says
to him
again
a second [time],
Simon
[son] of John,
do you love
me?
he says
to him,
yes,
lord,
you
know
that
I am fond of
you.
he says
to him,
shepherd
the

having been given
among
men
by
which
it is necessary
for you to be saved
*
and observing
*
the
-
of Peter
confidence 
and
John
and
having perceived
that
men
uneducated
they are
and
untrained
they were marveling
were recognizing
and
them
that
with
-
Jesus
they were
the
and
man
seeing
with
them
having stood
the one
having been healed
they had nothing
*
to say in reply
and having commanded
*
them
outside
the
council
to depart
they were conferring
with
one another
saying
what
should we do
-
with these men?
*
for that indeed
*
*
a remarkable
sign
has occurred
through
them
to all
the ones
inhabiting
Jerusalem [is]
clear
and
not 
we are able
to deny [it]
but
lest
*
further
*
it may be spread
to
the
people
we may warn
them
no longer
to speak
in
-
name
this
to any
men
and
having called
them
they gave orders
-
at all
not to
speak
nor
to teach
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
-
but
Peter
and
John
having answered
said
to
them
if
right
it is
before
-
God
to you
to listen
rather
than
-
God
you decide
are not able
*
for
we
what
we saw
and
heard
not to speak
*
-
and
having threatened [them]further
they released
them
nothing
finding
-
how
they might punish
them
because of
the
people
because
all
were glorifying
-
God
on account of
the thing
having happened
for of years
*
was
more [than]
forty
the
man
upon
whom
had happened
-
this sign
*
-
of healing
* having been released
* and [after] ~
they came
to
-
their own [people]
and
reported
what things
to
them
the
chief priests
and
the
elders
said
-
and
having heard
with one mind
they lifted
[their] voice
to
-
God
and
said
master
you
the one
having made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
the things
in
them
the one
the
father
of us
through
spirit
[the] holy
by [the] mouth
of David
[the] servant
of you
having spoken
why
raged
[the] nations
and
[the] people
imagined
empty things?
took their stand
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
rulers
assembled
together
*
*
against
the
Lord
and
against
the
Christ
of him
were assembled
for 
in
truth
in
-
city
this
against
the
holy
servant
of you
Jesus
whom
you anointed
both Herod
*
and
Pontius
Pilate
with
[the] Gentiles
and
[the] People
of Israel
to do
whatever
the
hand
of you
and
the
will
of you
predestined
to occur
and
-
now
Lord
look
upon
the
threats
of them
and
give
to the
slaves
of you
with
boldness
all 
to speak
the
word
of you
while
*
-
your hand
*
you stretch out
*
for
healing
and
signs
and
wonders
to occur
through
the
name
of the
holy
servant
of you
Jesus
and
[after] they having prayed
*
was shaken
the
place
in
which
they had assembled
*
and
everyone was filled
*
with the
holy
spirit
and
they were speaking
the
word
-
of God
with
boldness
now the
*
number
of the ones
having believed
were
heart
and
soul
one [in]
and
not
one
any
of the
possessions [belonging]
to him
was saying [that]
it was his own
*
but
was
to them
everything
[in] common
and
with great power
*
were giving
-
testimony
the
apostles
of the
resurrection
of the
Lord
Jesus
grace
and
great
was
upon
them all
*
not
for
needy
anyone
was 
among
them
as many as
for
owners
of lands
or
houses
were
selling [them]
they were bringing
the
proceeds
of the things
being sold
and
were placing [them]
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
and they were distributing
*
to each [one]
as
*
anyone
was having need
*
Joseph
and 
the one
having been named
Barnabas
by
the
apostles
which
means
being translated
son
of encouragement
a Levite
of Cyprus
by
nationality
belonging
to him
a field
having sold [it]
he brought
the
money
and
laid it
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
man
and
a certain
Ananias
by name
with
Sapphira
the
wife
of him
sold
property
and
he misappropriated
from
the
price
having known
also
the
wife
and
having brought
a certain part
*
at
the
feet
of the
apostles
he laid [it]
but said
*
-
Peter
Ananias
why
*
filled
-
Satan
the
heart
of you [that]
lied
you
to the
spirit
-
holy
and
misappropriated
from
the
price
of the
land?
not
[while] remaining
with you
it was remaining
and
having been sold
in
-
your
authority
it was ?
why
*
was put
in
the
heart
of you
-
this deed ?
*
you did not lie
*
to men
but
-
to God
and hearing
*
-
Ananias
-
these words
*
having fallen down
he died
and
there came
fear
great
upon
all
the ones
listening
and having arisen
*
the
young men
wrapped up
him
and
having carried [him] out
they buried [him]
and there was
*
about
hours
three
an interval  of
and
the
wife
of him
not having known
*
the thing
having happened
entered
having answered
and 
to
her
Peter [said]
tell
me
if
for so much
the
land
you sold ?
-
and
she said
yes
for so much
-
and
Peter
to
her
why
*
ws it agreed
by you
to test
the
spirit
of [the] Lord ?
behold
the
feet
of the ones
having buried
the
husband
of you [are]
at
the
door
and
they will carry out
you
and she fell
*
immediately
at
the
feet
of him
and
died
and having entered
*
the
young men
they found
her
dead
and
having carried [her] out
they buried [her]
with
the
husband
of her
and
there came
great fear
*
upon
[the] hole
-
church
and
upon
all
the ones
hearing
these things
now by
*
the
hands
of the
apostles
were being performed
signs
and
wonders
many
among
the
people
and
were
with one mind
everyone
in
the
portico
of Solomon
but of the
*
rest
no one
was daring
to associate
with them
but
were exalting
them
the
people
and more
*
were being added
[ones] believing
in the
Lord
multitudes
of both men
*
and
women
so as
even
into
the
streets
to carry out
the
sick
and
to put [them]
on
beds
and
mats
that
coming
of Peter
at least
the
shadow
might fall upon
some
of them
was assembling
and 
also
the
multitude
of the
cities surrounding
*
Jerusalem
carrying
[the] sick
and [the ones]
being tormented
by
unclean spirits
*
who
were being healed
all
having arisen
and 
the
high priest
and
all
the ones
with
him
(being ~ the
*
sect
of the
Sadducees)
they were filled
with jealousy
and
laid
the (their)
hands
upon
the
apostles
and
put
them
in
[the] jail
public
and an angel
*
of [the] Lord
during
[the] night
having opened
the
doors
of the
jail
and having led out
*
them
said
Go
and
having stood
speak
in
the
temple
to the
people
all
the
words
-
of this life
*
and having heard
*
they entered
about
-
daybreak
into
the
temple
and
were teaching
and having come
*
the
high priest
and
the ones
with
him
they called together
the
council
and
all
the
assembly of elders
of the
sons
of Israel
and
they sent
to
the
jail [for the prisoners]
to be brought
to them
the
but
having come
servants
did not find
*
them
in
the
jail
and having returned
*
they reported [these things]
saying
-
the
jail
we found
having been closed
with
all
security
and
the
guards
having stood
at
the
doors
but having opened [it]
*
inside
we found no one
*
and when
*
they heard
-
words
these
the
both
captain
of the
temple
and
the
chief priests
were perplexed
about
them
what
this ~ might come to be
*
*
and having come
*
someone
reported
to them
-
behold
the
men
whom
you put
in
the
jail
are
in
the
temple
having stood
and
teaching
the
people
then
having departed
the
captain [of the temple]
with
the
servants
were leading
them
not
with
force
for they feared
*
the
people
lest
they should be stoned
and having brought
*
them
they stood
in
the
council
and
questioned
them
the
high priest
saying
[did we] not
with a strict command
charge
you
not
to teach
in
-
name
this 
and
behold
you have filled
-
Jerusalem
with the
teaching
of you
and
are determind
to bring
upon
us
the
blood
-
of this man
*
and having answered
*
Peter
and
the
apostles
said
to  obey
it is necessary
God
rather
than
men
the
God
of the
fathers
of us
raised
Jesus
whom
you
killed
having hung
on
a tree
this one
-
God
[as] a prince
and
savior
exalted
to the
right
of him
-
to grant
repentance
-
to Israel
and
forgiveness
of sins
and
we
are
witnesses
-
of these matter
*
and
the
spirit
-
holy
which
gave
-
God
to the ones
obeying
him
the ones
and
having heard
were infuriated
and
were deciding
to do away with
them
but having arisen
*
a certain
in
the
council
Pharisee
by name
Gamaliel
a teacher of the law
respected
by all
the
people
commaned
ouside
[for] a little [while]
the
men
to put
and said
*
to
them
men
Israelites
pay attention
to yourselves
with
-
these men
*
what
you are about
to do
for before
*
these
-
days
arose
Theudas
saying
to be
someone
himself
to whom
were assiciated
a number of men
*
about
four hundred
who
was done away with
and
all
as many as
were obeying
himself
were dispersed
and
it came
to
nothing
after
this
arose
Judas
the
Galilean
in
the
days
of the
Census
and
misled
[the] people
[to] follow after
him
and that one
perished
and
all
as many as
werer obeying
him
were scattered
and
-
now
I say
to you
stay away
from
-
these men
*
and
leave
them [alone]
because
if
it is
of
men
-
this plan
*
or
-
this matter
*
it will be overthrown
but if
*
from
God
it is
you
are not able
to overthrow
them
lest
also
opposing God
you may be found
and they were persuaded
*
by him
and
having called together
the
apostles [and]
having beat [them]
they warned [them]
not to speak
*
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
and
they released [them]
-
-
therefore
they were going
rejoicing
from
[the] presence
of the
council
that
they were considered worthy
for
the
name
to suffer shame
and every
*
day
in
the
temple
and
* from house to house
*
not
they did ~ stop
teaching
and
preaching
-
Christ
Jesus
now in
*
-
these days
*
of being increased
the
disciples
there was
a complaint
by the
Hellenists
against
the
Hebrews
that
were being overlooked
in
the
support
-
daily
the
widows
of them
having called together
and
the
twelve
the
multitude
of the
disciples
said
not
desirable
is it
for us
having neglected
the
word
-
of God
to serve
tables
but select
*
brothers
men
among
you
being well spoken of
seven
full
of [the] spirit
and
wisdom
whom
we will appoint
over
-
this duty
*
we
but 
-
to prayer
and
to the
service
of the
word
will be devoted
and
pleased
the
word
before
all
the
multitude
and
they chose
Stephen
a man
full
of faith
and
[the] holy spirit
*
and
Philip
and
Prochorus
and
Nicanor
and
Timon
and
Parmenas
and
Nicolas
a proselyte
of Antioch
whom
they placed
before
the
apostles
and
having prayed
they laid upon
them
the (their)
hands
and
the
word
-
of God
was increasing
and
was being multiplied
the
number
of the
disciples
in
Jerusalem
greatly
a great
and 
crowd
of the
priests
were obeying
the
faith
Stephen
and 
full
of grace
and
power
was performing
wonders
and
signs
great 
among
the
people
having arisen
but 
some
of the ones
from
the
synagogue
-
being called
Freedmen
and
Cyrenians
and
Alexandrians
and
the ones
from
Cilicia
and
Asia
debating
-
with Stephen
and
not
they were able
to contradict
the
wisdom
and
the
spirit
with which
he was speaking
then
they secretly instigated
men
saying
-
we have heard
him
speaking
words
blasphemous
against
Moses
and
-
God
they aroused
and 
the
people
and
the
elders
and
the
scribes
and
they came upon [him and]
they seized
him
and
they brought [him]
to
the
council
and they set up
*
witnesses
\\"\\"false\\"\\
saying
-
this man
*
not
is ~stopping
speaking
words
against
-
place
-
holy
this
and
the
law
we have heard
for 
him
saying
that
Jesus
the
Nazarene
this
will destroy
-
place
this 
and
will change
the
customs
which
handed down
to us
Moses
and
having looked intently
at
him
all
the ones
sitting
in
the
council
saw
the
face
of him
like
[the] face
of an angel
and said
*
the
high priest
if
these things
thus
it is ?
-
and
he said
men
brothers
and
fathers
listen
the
God
-
of glory
appeared
to the
father
of us
Abraham
[while] being
in
-
Mesopotamia
before
*
he lived
*
in
Haran
and
he said
to
him
depart
from
the
land
of you
and
from
the
relatives
of you
and
come
to
the
land
which ever
*
I may show you
*
then
having departed
from
[the] land
of [the] Chaldeans
he settled
in
Haran
and from there
after
the
death [of]
the
father
of him
he resettled
him
in
-
this land
*
in
which
we
now
are living
and
he did not give
*
to him
an inheritance
in
it
nor
[the] step
of a foot
and
he promised
to give
to him
for
a possession
it
and
to the
seed
of him
after
him
not
being
to him
a child
and spoke
*
thus
-
God
that
will be
the
seed
of him
a stranger
in
anothers land
*
and
they will enslave
it  (them)
and
they will mistreat [them]
four  hundred years
*
and
the
nation
in whichever
*
they will serve as slaves
will judge
I
-
God
said
and
after
these things
they will come out
and
will serve
me
in
-
place
this
and
he gave
to him
a covenant
of circumcision
and
thus
he became [the] father of
-
Isaac
and
circumcised
him
on the
day
-
eighth
and
Isaac [became the father of]
-
Jacob
and
Jacob
[of] the
twelve
patriarchs
and
the
patriarchs
having been jealous of
-
Joseph
sold [him]
into
Egypt
and
was
-
God
with
him
and
he delivered
him
from
all
the
tribulations
of him
and
gave
to him
grace
and
wisdom
before
Pharaoh
king
of Egypt
and
he appointed
him
[the one]ruling
over
Egypt
and
over
the whole
*
house
of him
now came
*
a famine
over
all
-
Egypt
and
Canaan
and
tribulation
great
and
were not finding
*
food
the
fathers
of us
and having heard
*
Jacob
wheat being
*
in
Egypt
he sent out
the
fathers
of us
first
and
on
the
second [visit]
was made known again
Joseph
to the
brothers
of him
and
manifest
became
-
to Pharaoh
the
family
-
of Joseph
and having sent
*
Joseph
summoned
Jacob
the
father
of him
and
all
the
relatives
in
souls
seventy five
*
and
came down
Jacob
to
Egypt
and
he died
*
and
the
fathers
of us
and
they were brought back
to
Shechem
and
were placed
in
the
tomb
which
bought
Abraham
for a sum
of silver
from
the
sons
of Hamor
in
Shechem
as
now 
was drawing near
the
time
of the
promise
which
promised
-
God
-
to Abraham
grew
the
people
and
were multiplied
in
Egypt
until
*
arose
another king
*
over
Egypt
who
had not
known
-
Joseph
this one
having taken advantage of
the
nation
of us
mistreated
the
fathers
of us
-
to make
the
infants
exposed
of them 
in order
-
not
to keep [them] alive
in
which
time
was born
Moses
and
he was
well pleasing
-
to God
who
was nurtured [for]
three months
*
in
the
house
of the (his)
father
having been exposed
and
him
took up
him
the
daughter
of Pharaoh
and
she raised
him
for herself
as
a son
and
was instructed
Moses
in
all
[the] wisdom
of [the] Egyptians
and he was
*
powerful
in
words
and
deeds
of him
but when
*
was fulfilled
in him
forty years
time
arose
upon
the
heart
of him
to visit
the
brothers
of him
the
sons
of Israel
and
having seen
someone
being treated unjustly
he retaliated
and
brought
justice
for the one
being oppressed
having struck down
the
Ehyptian
now he was thinking
*
to understand
the
brothers
of him
that
-
God
by
[the] hand
of him
is giving
salvation
to them
-
but
they did not
understand
and on the
*
next
day
he appeared
to them [as they were]
fighting
and
was reconciling
them
to
peace
having said
men
you are brothers
*
why
are you injuring
one another ?
the one
but
injuring
the (his)
neighbor
pushed aside
him
having said
who
appointed you
*
ruler
and
judge
over
us ?
[do] not
to kill
me
you
wish
in the same manner as
*
you killed
yesterday
the
Egyptian?
and fled
*
Moses
at
-
this word
*
and
became
a stranger
in
[the] land
of Midian
where
he became [the] father of
two sons
*
and
having been fulfilled
forty
years
appeared
to him
in
the
desert
of the
mountain
Sinai
an angel
in
[the] flame
of fire
of a thorn bush
-
and
Moses
having seen [this]
was amazed at
the
vision
approaching
and
it
to look [more] closely
came
[the] voice
of [the] Lord
I [am]
the
God
of the
fathers
of you
the
God
of Abraham
and
Isaac
and
Jacob
but trembling
*
having become
Moses
he was not
daring
to look
and said
*
to him
the
Lord
untie
the
sandal
of the
feet
of you
for the
*
place
on
which
you have stood
ground
holy
is
having seen
I saw
the
mistreatment
of the
people
of me
-
in
Egypt
and
the
groaning
of them
I heard
and
I came down
to deliver
them
and
now
come
[that] I may send
you
to
Egypt
this
-
Moses
whom
they denied
having said
who
you
appointed
ruler
and
judge ?
this one
-
God
both
a ruler
and
redeemer
has sent
with
[the] hand
of [the] angel
-
having appeared
to him
in
the
thorn bush
this one
led out
them
having done
wonders
and
signs
in
[the] land
[of] Egypt
and
in
[the] red
sea
and
in
the
desert
forty years
*
this
is
the
Moses
the one
having said
to the
sons
of Israel
a prophet
for you
will raise up
-
God
from
the
brothers
of you
like
me
this
is
the one
having been
in
the
assembly
in
the
desert
with
the
angel
-
speaking
to him
at
the
mountain
of Sinai
and
the
fathers
of us
who
received
words
living 
to give
to us
to whom
did not want
*
to become obedient
*
the
fathers
of us
but
they pushed [him] aside
and
turned away
in
the
hearts
of them
to
Egypt
having said
-
to Aaron
make
for us
gods
who
will go on before
us
-
for
Moses
this
who
led out
us
from
[the] land
of Egypt
not
we do know
what
happened
to him
and
they made a calf
in
-
those days
*
and
brought
an offering
to the
idol
and
were taking delight
in
the
works
of the
hands
of them
but turned away
*
-
God
and
handed over
them
to serve
the
army
-
of heaven
just as
it has been written
in
[the] book
of the
prophets
not
sacrifices
and
offerings
did you bring
to me
forty years
*
in
the
desert
house
of Israel [did you] ?
and
you took up
the
tent
-
of Moloch
and
the
star
of the
God
of you
Rephan
the
images
which
you made
to worship
them
and
I will deport
you
beyond
Babylon
the
tent
-
of witness
was
to the
fathers
of us
in
the
desert
just as
commanded
the one
speaking
-
to Moses
to make
it
according to
the
pattern
which
he had seen
which
also
they brought in
having received [it] in turn
the
fathers
of us
with
Joshua
in
-
taking possession [of the land]
of the
Gentiles
whom
drove out
-
God
from
[the] presence
of the
fathers
of us
until
the
days
of David
who
found
grace
before
-
God
and
he asked
to find
a dwelling place
for the
house
of Jacob
and Solomon
*
built
for him
a house
but
not
the
most high
in
[a place] made by human hands
dwells
just as
the
prophet
says
-
heaven [is]
my
throne
and the
*
earth
[is the] footstool
of the
feet
of me
what kind of
house
will you build
for me
says
[the] Lord
or
what
place
-
of rest [is there]
for me ?
[did] not
the
hand
of me
make
all these things ?
*
[you] stiff necked [people]
and
uncircumcised
of heart
and
-
ears
you
always
the
spirit
-
holy
resist
like
the
fathers
of you [so]
also
[are] you
which
of the
prophets
did not
persecute
the
fathers
of you ?
and
they killed
the ones
having announced before hand
about
the
coming
of the
righteous [one]
of whom
now
you
betrayers
and
murderers
became
who
received
the
law
by
directions
of angels
and
you did not keep [it]
*
and hearing
*
these things
they were infuriated
in the
hearts
of them
and
they were grinding
the (their)
teeth
at
him
but being
*
full
of [the] holy spirit [and]
*
having gazed
into
-
heaven
he saw
[the] glory
of God
and
Jesus
having stood
at
[the] right
-
of God
and
he said
behold
I see
the
heavens
having been opened
and
the
son
-
of man
at
[the] right
having stood
-
of God
and having cried out
*
with a loud voice
*
they shut
the
ears
of them
and
they rushed down
with one impulse
upon
him
and
having driven [him]out
outside
the
city
they were stoning [him]
and
the
witnesses
took off
the
garments
of them
at
the
feet
of a young man
being called
Saul
and
they were stoning
-
Stephen [and he]
calling upon [God]
and
saying
Lord
Jesus
receive
the
spirit
of me
and having fallen on
*
the
knees
he cried out
in a loud voice
*
Lord
not
may you place [against]
them
this
-
sin
and
this
having said
he fell asleep
and Saul
*
was
giving approval
to the
murder
of him
and there came about
*
in
that
-
day
a persecution
great 
against
the
church
-
in
Jerusalem
everyone
and 
was scattered
throughout
the
regions
-
of Judea
and
Samaria
except
the
apostles
buried
and
-
Stephen
men
devout
and
they made
loud lamentation
*
over
him
but Saul
*
was destroying
the
church
* house by house
*
*
entering
dragging
both
men
and
women
he was delivering [them]
to
jail
the ones
-
therefore
having been scattered
went about
preaching
the
word
Philip
now 
having gone down
to
the
city
-
of Samaria
was preaching
to them
the
Christ
were paying attention
and ~
the
crowds
to the things
being said
by
-
Philip
with one accord
* while
*
~ hear [him]
they ~
and
see
the
signs
which
he was doing
for many
*
of the ones
having
spirits
unclean
crying out
with a voice
loud 
were coming out
and many
*
having been paralyzed
and
lame [ones]
were healed
there was
and 
great
joy
in
-
that city
*
man
now
a certain
by name
Simon
was previously
in
the
city
practicing magic
and
astonishing
the
people
-
of Samaria
saying
to be
someone
himself 
great
to whom
were paying attention
everyone
from
[the] small
to
[the] great
saying
this
is
the
power
-
of God
-
being called
great
they were paying attention
and 
to him
because [he]
-
for a long
time
by the
magic tricks
to have astonished
them
but when
*
they believed
-
Philip
preaching
about
the
kingdon
-
of God
and
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
were being baptized
both men
*
and
women
-
and
Simon
also
himself 
believed
and
having been baptized
he was
following
-
Philip
seeing
and 
signs
and
miracles
great
being done
he was amazed
having heard
and
the
in
Jerusalem
apostles
that
has accepted
-
Samaria
the
word
-
of God
they sent
to
them
Peter
and
John
who
having come down
prayed
for
them
that
they might receive
[the] holy spirit
*
not yet
for 
had he
upon
anyone
of them
fallen
but only
*
they had been baptized
*
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
then
they were laying
the (their)
hands
upon
them
and
they were receiving
[the] holy spirit
*
and having seen
*
-
Simon
that
through
the
laying on
of the
hands
of the
apostles
is given
the
spirit
he brought
to them
money
saying
give
me also
-
authority
this
that
whomever
*
I may lay
the (my)
hands
he may receive
[the] holy spirit
*
but Peter
*
said
to
him
the
silver
of you
with
you
may it be
to
destruction
because
the
gift
-
of God
you thought
by
money
to acquire
not
there is 
to you
a part
nor
share
in
-
this matter
*
for the
*
heart
of you
not
is 
upright
before
-
God
therefore repent
*
of
-
wickedness
of you
this
and
pray
to the
Lord
if
perhaps
will be forgiven
you
the
intent
of the
heart
of you
in
for
gall
bitter
and
[the] bond
of unrighteousness
I see
you
being
and having answered
*
-
Simon
said
pray
you 
for
me
to
the
Lord
that
nothing
may come
upon
me
of which
you have spoken
the ones
-
then
having  testified
and
spoken
the
Word
of the
Lord
were returning
to
Jerusalem
to many
and
villages
of the
Samaritans
were preaching the good news
an angel
and 
of [the] Lord
spoke
to
Philip
saying
get up
and
go
toward
[the] south
on
the
road
-
going down
from
Jerusalem
to
Gaza
this
is
desert
and
having arisen
he went
and
behold
a man
Ethiopian
a eunuch
a court official
of Candace
queen
of [the] Ethiopians
who
was
over
all
the
treasury
of her
who
had come
worshiping
to
Jerusalem
he was
and 
returning
and
sitting
in
the

of him
and
he was reading
the
prophet
Isaiah

and
the
spirit

to Philip
approach
and
join

this
having run
and 
-
Philip
heard
him
reading
Isaiah
the
prophet
and
he said
* so then
*
do you understand
what
you are reading ?
-
and
he said
how
then
might
I be able
unless
*
someone
will guide
me ?
he invited
and
-
Philip
having come up
to sit
with
him
the
now
passage
of the
scripture
which
he was reading
was
this
as
a sheep
to
[the] slaughter
he was led
and
as
a lamb
before
the one
having sheared
it [is]
silent
so
not
he does open
the
mouth
of him
in
the
humiliation
of him
the
judgment
of him
was taken away
the
descendants
of him
who
will tell ?
because
is taken away
from
the
earth
the
life
of him
having answered
and 
the
eunuch
-
to Philip
said
I ask
you
about
whom
the
prophet
says
this ?
about
himself
or
about
some other [person] ?
*
and having opened
*
-
Philip
the
mouth
of him
and
having begun
from
-
scripture
this
he preached
to him
-
Jesus
as
now
they were going
along
the
road
they came
upon
some
water
and
says
the
eunuch
behold
water
what
prevents
me
to be baptized ?
and
he commanded
to stand
the
chariot
and
went down
both
into
the
water
-
both
Philip
and
the
eunuch
and
he baptized
him
when
and
they came up
from
the
water
[the] spirit
of [the] Lord
took away
-
Philip
and
not
did see
him
any longer
the
eunuch
he was going
for
the
way
of him
rejoicing
* Philip
* but
was found
in
Azotus
and
passing through
he was preaching the good news
the
cities
to all
until
* ~ would
* come
* he ~
to
Caesarea
-
now
Saul
still
breathing
a threat
even
of murder
to
the
disciples
of the
Lord
having approached
the
high priest
he requested
from
him
letters
to
Damascus
to
the
synagogues
that
if
someone
he should find
of the
way
being
both men
*
and
women
having been bound
he may lead [them]
to
Jerusalem
now as [he]
*
*
goes
it came about [that]
he
comes near
-
Damascus
and suddenly
*
him
shone around
a light
from
-
heaven
and
having fallen
on
the
ground
he heard
a voice
saying
to him
Saul
Saul
why
are you persecuting me ?
*
and he said
*
who
are you
Lord ?
-
and [he said ]
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
but
get up
and
enter
into
the
city
and
it will be told
to you
what
*
it is necessary for you
*
to do
and the
*
men
-
traveling with
him
had stood
speechless
hearing
-
the
voice
no one
but
seeing
and was raised
*
Saul
from
the
ground
and having been opened
*
the
eyes
of him
he was seeing nothing
*
and being led by the hand
*
they brought him
*
into
Damascus
and
he was
three days
*
not
seeing
and
did not eat
*
nor
drink
now there was
*
a certain
disciple
in
Damascus
by name
Ananias
and
spoke
to
him
in
a vision
the
Lord
Ananais
-
and
he said
behold
I [am here]
Lord
and the
*
Lord [said]
to
him
having arisen
go
to
the
street
-
being called
straight
and
seek
in
[the] house
of Judas
Saul
by name
[a man] from Tarsus
for behold
*
he is praying
and
he saw
a man
in
a vision
Ananias
by name
having entered
and
having placed upon
him
the (his)
hands
that
he may see again
and answered
*
Ananias
Lord
I heard
from
many
about
-
this man
*
how many
evil things
to the
saints
of you
he did
in
Jerusalem
and
here
he has
authority
from
the
chief priests
to bind
all
the ones
calling upon
the
name
of you
but said
*
to
him
the
Lord
go
for
instrument
a chosen
is
to me
this one
-
to carry
the
name
of me
before
Gentiles
both
and
kings
~ [the] sons
and ~
of Israel
for I
*
will show
to him
how much
it is necessary
for him
on behalf of
the
name
of me
to suffer
and departed
*
Ananias
and
entered
into
the
house
and
having placed
upon
him
the (his)
hands
he said
brother Saul
*
the
Lord
has sent
me
Jesus
the one
having appeared
to you
on
the
road
by which
you were coming
that
you may see again
and
may be filled
with [the] holy spirit
*
and
immediately
fell
his
from
-
eyes
[something] like
scales
he saw again
and
and
having arisen
he was baptized
and
having received
food
he regained strength
he was
now 
with
the
in
Damascus
disciples
days
some
and
immediately
in
the
synagogues
he was preaching
-
Jesus
that
this one
is
the
son
-
of God
and were astonished
*
all
the ones
listening
and
they were saying
not
this one
is
the one
having destroyed
in
Jerusalem
the ones
calling upon
-
this name
*
and
here
for
this [reason]
he had come
that
having bound
them
he might lead [them]
to
the
chief priests ?
but Saul
*
[even] more
was being strengthened
and
was confounding
the
Jews
the ones
dwelling
in
Damascus
demonstrating
that
this one
is
the
Christ
but when
*
were fulfilled
many days
*
plotted
the
Jews
to kill
him
but was made known
*
-
to Saul
the
plot
of them
and they were watching
*
also
the
gates
day
both 
and
night
that
him
they might kill
having taken
but
the
disciples
him
during [the] night
through
the
wall
they let down
him
having lowered [him]
in
a basket
having arrived
and 
in
Jerusalem
he was trying
to be associated
with the
discciples
and
all
were afraid
of him
not
believing
that
he is
a disciple
Barnabas
but
having taken hold of
him
brought [him]
to
the
apostles
and
told
them
how
on
the
road
he saw
the
Lord
and
that
he spoke
to him
and
how
in
Damascus
he spoke boldly
in
the
name
-
of Jesus
and
he was
with
them
entering
and
exiting
in
Jerusalem
speaking boldly
in
the
name
of the
Lord
he was speaking
and 
and
debating
with
the
Hellenists
-
and
they were attempting
to kill
him
but having learned [of this]
*
the
brothers
brought down
him
to
Caesarea
and
sent out
him
to
Tarsus
the
so

of Judea
and
Galilee
and
Samaria
had
peace
being built up
and
going [on]
in the
fear
of the
Lord
and
in the
comfort
of the
holy
spirit
it was increasing
it came about [that ]
now 
Peter
passing
through
all [areas]
to come down
also
to
the
saints
the ones
dwelling
in Lydda
and he found

there

she was doing
and it came about
*
in
-
those days
*
having become sick
this one
died
and having washed [her]
*
they put
this one
in
[the] upper story
near
and 
being
Lydda
-
to Joppa
the
disciples
having heard
that
Peter
is
in
it
they sent
two
men
to
him
summoning [him] [that]
he may not hesitate
*
to come
to
us
and having arisen
*
Peter
went with
them
whom
having arrived
they brought up
into
the
upper story
and
stood beside
him
all
the
widows
crying
and
showing
[the] shirts
and
garments
as many as
was making
with
them
[while] being
-
Dorcas
and having put out
*
outside
everyone
-
Peter
and
having fallen on
the (his)
knees
he prayed
and
having turned
to
the
body
he said
Tabitha
get up
-
and
she opened
the
eyes
of her
and
having seen
-
Peter
she sat up
and having given
*
to her
[his] hand
he raised up
her
and having called
*
the
saints
and
the
widows
he presented
her
living
known
and
it became
throughout
all
-
Joppa
and
many believed
*
on
the
Lord
and it came about
*
days
many
[he] remained
in
Joppa
with
a certain
Simon
a tanner
man
now
a certain
in
Caesarea
by name
Cornelius
a centurion
from
[the] cohort
-
being called
[the]  Italian
devout
and
fearing
-
God
with
all
the
house
of him
practicing
charitable giving
much
to the
people
and
praying
-
to God
always
*
he saw
in
a vision
clearly
about
around
[the] hour
ninth
of the
day
an angel
-
of God
having come
to
him
and
having said
to him
Cornelius
-
and
having looked intently
at him
and
afraid
having become
he said
what
is it
Lord ?
and he said
*
to him
the
prayers
of you
and
the
charitable giving
of you
went up
for
a memorial offering
before
-
God
and
now
send
[some] men
to
Joppa
and
send for
Simon
a certain
who
is [also] called
Peter
this one
is staying
with
a certain
Simon
a Tanner
to whom
is
a house
by
[the] sea
as
and
departed
the
angel
the one
speaking
to him
having called
two
-
household servants
and
soldier
a devout
of the ones
waiting upon
him
and
having explained
everything
to them
he sent
them
to
-
Joppa
now on the
*
next day
[as] traveling
those ones
and
to the
city
drawing near
went up
Peter
onto
the
roof
to pray
around
[the] sixth hour
*
he became
and ~
hungry
and
was wanting
to partake [of a meal]
[while]  were making preparations
and
they
there came
over
him
a trance
and
he sees
-
heaven
having been opened
and
coming down
~ object
a certain ~
like
linen cloth
a large
by four
corners
being let down
upon
the
ground
in
which
were
all
the
four footed animals
and
reptiles
of the
earth
and
birds
of the
heaven
and
there came
a voice
to
him
having arisen
Peter
kill
and
eat
-
but
Peter
said
by no means
Lord
because
never
did I eat
all things
common
and
unclean
and
[the] voice
again
for
a second [time came]
to
him
what
-
God
made clean
you
not
do declare unclean
this
and
happened
on
three [occasions]
and
immediately
was taken up
the
object
into
-
heaven
now as
*
within
himself
was perplexed
-
Peter
what
might
be
the
vision
which
he saw
behold
the
men
-
having been  sent
by
-
Cornelius
having found by inquiring
the
house
-
of Simon
they stood
at
the
gate
and
having called
they were asking
if
Simon
the one
being called
Peter
here
is staying
-
now [as]
Peter
reflecting
on
the
vision
said
to him
the
spirit
behold
men [are]
three
looking for
you
but
having arisen
go down
and
go
with
them
without 
hesitating
because
I
have sent
them
and having come down
*
Peter
to
the
men
he said
behold
I
am
whom
you are seeking
what [is]
the
reason
for
which
you are present ?
-
and
they said
Cornelius
a centurion
a man
righteous
and
fearing
-
God
being well spoken of
and
by
all
the
nation
of the
Jews
was directed
by
an angel
holy
to summon
you
to
the
house
of him
and
to hear
words
from
you
having invited in
therefore
them
he received [them] as guests
on the
and 
next day
having arisen
he went out
with
them
and
some
of the
brothers
of the ones
from
Joppa
accompanied
him
on the
and
next day
he entered
into
-
Caesarea
-
and
Cornelius
was 
expecting
them
having called together
the
relatives
of him
and
the
close
friends
when
now
it came about [that]
-
entered
-
Peter
having met
him
-
Cornelius
having fallen
at
the (his)
feet
worshiped [him]
-
but
Peter
raised up
him
saying
stand up
I also
*
myself
a man
am
and
talking
with him
he entered
and
finds
having assembled
many 
and he said
*
to
them
you
know
how
unlawful
it is 
for a Jewish 
* man
to associate with
or
to approach
a foreigner
and to me
-
God
showed
no one
common
or
unclean
to call
a man
therefore
also
raising no objections
I came
having been summoned
I ask
therefore
for what
reason
you summoned
me ?
and
-
Cornelius
said
from
[the] fourth
day
until
this
-
hour
I was
at the
ninth
praying
in
the
house
of me
and
behold
a man
stood
before
me
in
clothing
shining
and
he says
Cornelius
was heard
your
-
prayer
and
the
charitable giving
of you
are remembered
before
-
God
send
therefore 
to
Joppa
and
summon
Simon
who
is called
Peter
this one
is staying
in
[the] house
of Simon
[the] tanner
by
[the] sea
at once
therefore 
I sent
for
you
you
and
well
did 
having come
now
therefore 
all
we
before
-
God
are present
to hear
all
the things
having been commanded
to you
by
the
Lord
having opened
and
Peter
the (his)
mouth
he said
he said
truly
I understand
that
not
is 
one to show partiality
-
God
but
in
every
nation
the one
fearing
him
and
working
righteousness
acceptable
to him
is
the
word
which
he sent
to the
sons
of Israel
preaching
peace
through
Jesus
Christ
this one
is
of all
Lord
you
know
the
having happened
thing 
throughout
all
-
Judea
having begun
from
-
Galilee
after
the
baptism
which
preached
John 
Jesus
the one
from
Nazareth
how
anointed
him
-
God
with [the] holy spirit
*
and
with power
who
went about
doing good
and
healing
all
the ones
being oppressed
by
the
devil
because
-
God
was
with
him
and
we [are]
witnesses
of all things
which
he did
in
both
the
country
of the
Jews
and
in
Jerusalem
whom
also
they killed
having hung [him]
on
a tree
this one
-
God
raised up
on
the
third
day
and
granted
to him
to visible
be 
not
to all
the
people
but
to witnesses
-
having been chosen beforehand
by
-
God
to us
who
ate together
and
drank together
with him
after
-
rose again
he
from
[the] dead
and
he commanded
us
to preach
to the
people
and
to testify
that
this one
is
the one
having been appointed
by
-
God [as]
judge
of [the] living
and
[the] dead
to this one
all
the
prophets
bear witness
forgiveness
of sins
to receive
through
the
name
of him
everyone
-
believing
in
him
[while ] still
speaking
-
Peter
-
words
these
fell
the
spirit
-
holy
upon
all
the ones
hearing
the
word
and
were amazed
the
of
[the] circumcision
faithful
as many as
accompanied
-
Peter
that
also
upon
the
Gentiles
the
gift
of the
holy
spirit
has been poured out
for they were hearing
*
them
speaking
in tongues
and
exalting
-
God
then
answered
Peter
[surely] not
the
water
is able
to refuse
anyone
-
not
to be baptized
these
who
the
spirit
-
holy
received
as
also
we ?
he commanded
and 
them
in
the
name
of Jesus
Christ
to be baptized
then
they asked
him
to remain
days
some
and heard
*
the
apostles
and
the
brothers
the ones
being
throughout
-
Judea
that
also
the
gentiles
received
the
word
-
of God
when
but 
went up
Peter
to
Jerusalem
were taking issue
with
him
the ones
of
[the] circumcision
saying
-
you entered
to [a house]
men
uncircumcised
having
and
you ate
with them
having begun
and
Peter
was explaining
to them
in order
saying
I
was
in
[the] city
of Joppa
praying
and
I saw
in
a trance
a vision
coming down
object
a certain 
like
a linen cloth
large
by four
corners
being let down
from
-
heaven
and
it came
up to
me
into
which
having gazed
I was observing
and
I saw
-
four-footed animals
of the
earth
and
-
beasts
and
-
reptiles
and
-
birds
of the
heaven
and I heard
*
also
a voice
saying
to me
having arisen
Peter
kill
and
eat
but I said
*
by no means
Lord
because
common
or
unclean [things]
never
entered
into
the
stomach
of me
answered
and 
[the] voice
for
a second [time]
from
-
heaven
what
-
God
made clean
you
do not
declare unclean
and this
*
happened
on
three [occasions]
and
was pulled up
again
everything
into
-
heaven
and
behold
at once
three
men
stood
at
the
house
in
which
I was
having been sent
from
Caesarea
to
me
and said
*
the
spirit
to me
to accompany
them
without 
making a distinction
came
and 
with
me
also
-
six
brothers
these
and
we entered
into
the
house
of the
man
and he reported
*
to us
how
he saw
the
angel
in
the
house
of him
having stood
and
having said
send
to
Joppa
and
summon
Simon
the one
being called
Peter
who
will speak
words
to
you
by
which
will be saved
you
and
all
the
house
of you
as
and
*
began
I
to speak
fell
the
spirit
-
holy
upon
them
just as
also
upon
us
in
[the] beginning
and I remembered
*
the
word
of the
Lord
how
he was saying
John
-
baptized
with water
but you
*
will be baptized
with
[the] holy spirit
*
if
then
the
same
gift
gave
to them
-
God
as
also
to us
having believed
on
the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
[to be]
who
was
able
to hinder
-
God?
and having heard
*
these things
they remained silent
and
glorified
-
God
saying
then
also
to the
gentiles
-
God
-
repentance
to
life
gave
the ones
-
then
having been scattered
from
the
tribulation
of the thing
having happened
to
Stephen
came
to
Phoenicia
and
Cyprus
and
Antioch
to no one
speaking
the
word
except
*
only
to Jews
there were
and 
some
of
them
men
of Cyprus
and
Cyrene
who
having come
to
Antioch
were speaking
also
to
the
Greeks
preaching
the
Lord
Jesus
and
was
[the] hand
of [the] Lord
with
them
a large
and
number
-
having believed
turned
to
the
Lord
was heard
and ~
the
report
in
the
ears
of the
church
the one
being
in
Jerusalem
about
them
and
they sent out
Barnabas
go
to
Antioch
who
having come
and
having seen
the
grace
-
-
of God
rejoiced
and
was encouraging
everyone
-
devoted
-
of heart
to remain
to the
Lord
because
he was
a man
good
and
full
of [the] holy spirit
*
and
faith
and
was added
a crowd
large
to the
Lord
he left
and 
for
Tarsus
to look
for Saul
and
having found [him]
he brought [him]
to
Antioch
and it came about
*
for them
also
a year
entire
to be assembled
in
the
church
and
to teach
a large crowd
*
and to call
*
first
in
Antioch
the
disciples
Christians
in
these
now
-
days
came down
from
Jerusalem
prophets
to
Antioch
and having arisen
*
one
of
them
by name
Agabus
indicated
through
the
spirit
a great famine
*
to be about
to be
on
all
the
inhabited earth
which
occurred
during  [the time]
of Claudius
now of the
*
disciples
as
having means
any
determined
each
of them
for
support
to send
to the
dwelling
in
-
Judea
brothers
which
also
they did
having sent
to
the
elders
by
[the] hand
of Barnabas
and
Saul
during
that
now
-
time
laid on
Herod
the
king
the (his)
hands
to harm
some
of the ones
from
the
church
he killed
and
James
the
brother
of John
with a sword
having seen
and 
that
pleasing
it is 
to the
Jews
he proceeded
to arrest
also
Peter,
[these things] were [during]
now
the
days
of the
unleavened [bread]
whom
also
having seized
he put
in
Jail
having handed [him] over
to four
squads of four
soldiers
to guard
him
intending
after
the
Passover
to bring
him [before]
the
people
-
-
therefore
Peter
was being kept
in
the
Jail

but 
was
earnestly
being made
by
the
church
to
-
God
for
him
when
but 
was about
to lead out

between
two
soldiers
having been bound
with two chains

guards
and 
before

and
behold
an angel
of [the] Lord
approached
and
light
shone
in
the
room
having struck
and 
the
side
-
of Peter
he raised up
him
saying
get up
with
quickness
and
fell off
of him
the
chains
from
the (his)
hands
and said
*
the
angel
to
him
put your belt on
and
tie
the
sandals
of you
he did
and 
so
and
he says
to him
put on
the
garment
of you
and
follow
me
and
having gone out
he was following [him]
and
he had
not known
that
real
is
the thing
happening
through
the
angel
he was thinking
but 
a vision
to see 
having gone through
and 
[the] first
guard
and
[the] second
they came
upon
the
gate

leading
to
the
city
which
by itself
was opened
to them
and
having gone out
they went along
street
one
and
immediately
went away
the
angel
from
him
and
-
Peter
to
himself
having come
said
now
I know
truly
that
sent out
the
Lord
the
angel
of him
and
delivered
me
from
[the] hand
of Herod
and
from all
the
expectation
of the
people
of the
Jews
having realized [this]
and 
he came
upon
the
house
-
of Mary

mother
of John
the one
being called
Mark
where
there were
many
having been assembled
and
praying
having knocked
and

the
door
of the
gate
approached
a servant girl
to listen
by name
Rhoda
and
having recognized
the
voice
-
of Peter
from
-
joy
not
she did open
the
gate
having run inside
but 
she reported [that]
has stood
-
Peter
at
the
gate
the ones [there]
but
to
her
said
you are out of your mind
-
but
she kept insisting [it]
so
to be 
-
but
they were saying
the
angel
it is
of him
-
but
Peter
was continuing
knocking
having opened [the gate]
and 
they saw
him
and
were amazed
having motioned
and 
to them
with the (his)
hand
to be silent
he told
them
how
the
Lord
him
let out
from
the
Jail

to James
and
to the

and
having come down
from

Judea
to
Caesarea
he was staying [there]
he was
now
very angry
with [the] Tyrians
and
[the] Sidonians
with one mind
and
they were coming
to
him
and

and 
struck
him
an angel
of [the] Lord

having gazed
at
him
said
O [man]
full
of all
deceit
and
all
fraud
son
of [the] devil
enemy
of all
righteousness
not
will you stop
making crooked
the
paths
of the
Lord

straight?
and
now
behold
[the] hand
of [the] Lord [is]
on
you
and
you will be
blind
not seeing
*
the
sun
for
a while
immediately
and 
fell
on
him
mistiness
and
darkness
and
going about
he was seeking
leaders [to guide him]
then
having seen
the
proconsul
the thing
having happened
he believed
being amazed
at

and
having entered
into
the
synagogue
on the
day
of the
Sabbaths
they sat down
after
and
the
reading
of the
law
and
the
prophets
sent
the
rulers of the synagogue
to
them
saying
men
brothers
if
any
there is
among
you
word
of encouragement
to
the
people
say [it]
and having arisen
*
Paul
and
having motioned
with the(his)
hand
he said
Men
Israelites
and
the ones
fearing
-
God
listen
the
God
-
of people
this
Israel
chose
the
fathers
of us
and
the
people
he made great
in
the (their)
sojourn
in
[the] land
of Egypt
and
with
arm
an uplifted
he led out
them
out of
it
and
about
forty years
time
he put up with
them
in
the
desert
and
having destroyed
seven nations
*
in
[the] land
of Canaan
he gave as an inheritance
the
land
of them
about
years
four hundred
and
fifty
and
after
these things
he gave
judges
until
Samuel
the
prophet
and then
they asked for
a king
and
gave
to them
-
God
-
Saul
[the] son
of Kish
a man
from
[the] tribe
of Benjamin
forty years
*
and
[after] having removed
him
he raised up
-
David
to them
for
a King
to whom
also
he said
having spoken favorably
I found
David
the [son]
-
of Jesse
a man
in accordance with
the
heart
of me
who
will do
all
the
will
of me
of this one
-
God
from
the
seed
according to
[the] promise
brought
-
to Israel
a savior
Jesus
having previously proclaimed
John
before
[the] presence
of the
entrance
of him
a baptism
of repentance
to all
the
people
of Israel
now when
*
was completing
John
the
course
he was saying
what
do you suppose me
*
to be?
am not [he]
*
I
but
behold
he comes
after
me
of whom
not
I am
worthy
the
sandal
of the
feet
to untie
men
brothers
sons
of [the] family
of Abraham
and
the ones
among
you
fearing
-
God
to us
the
word
-
salvation
of this 
was sent out
the ones
for
dwelling
in
Jerusalem
and
the
rulers
of them
this one
not having known
and
the
voices
of the
prophets
-
throughout
every
Sabbath
being read
having judged
they fulfilled [these words]
and
without
a reason
for death
having found
they asked
Pilate [that]
he be done away with
*
and when
*
they finished
all
the things
about
him
having been written
having taken [him] down
from
the
tree
they put [him]
into
a tomb
-
but
God
raised up
him
from
[the] dead
who
was seen
over
days
many
to the ones
having come up
with him
from
-
Galilee
to
Jerusalem
who
now
are
witnesses
of him
to
the
people
and
we
to you
are preaching
the
to
the
fathers
promise
having come
that
these things
-
God
has fulfilled
to the
children
of them
to us
having raised
Jesus
as
also
in
the
Psalm
it has been written
-
second
[the] son
of me
you are
*
today I
*
have become a father
to you
that
and
he raised
him
from
[the] dead
no longer
being about
to return
to
decay
thus
he has said
-
I will give
to you
the
decrees
of David
-
trustworthy
therefore
also
in
another [Psalm]
he says
you will not permit
*
the
holy one
of you
to experience
decay
David
-
for
in his own
generation
having served
by the
-
of God
will
fell asleep
and
he was gathered
to
the
fathers
of him
and
he experienced
decay
but whom
*
-
God
raised
did not experience
*
decay
known
therefore
let it be
to you
men
brothers
that
through
this one
to you
forgiveness
of sins
is proclaimed
and
from
all things
of which
you were not able
*
by
[the] law
of Moses
to be justified
by
this one
everyone
-
believing
is justified
be careful
then [that]
may not come upon [you]
*
the thing
having been spoken
by
the
prophets
look
-
scoffers
and
marvel
and
perish
because
a work
am working
I 
in
the
days
of you
a work
which
by no means
*
you may believe
if
someone
should tell
you
going out
and 
them
they were begging
for
the
next
Sabbath
to be spoken
to them
-
words
these
having broken up
and 
the
gathering
followed
many
of the
Jews
and
of the
worshiping
proselytes
-
Paul
and
-
Barnabas
who
speaking
to them
were convincing
them
to remain
in the
grace
-
of God
on the
now 
coming
Sabbath
nearly
all
the
city
was assembled
to hear
the
word
of the
Lord
having seen
and
the
Jews
the
crowd
they were filled with
jealousy
and
were contradicting
the things
by
Paul
being spoken
blaspheming
and having spoken boldly
*
-
Paul
and
-
Barnabas
said
to you
it was
necessary
first
to be spoken
the
word
-
of God
since
you reject
it
and
not
worthy
do you judge
yourselves
-
of eternal
life
behold
we are turning
to
the
gentiles
thus
for
has commanded
us
the
Lord
I have appointed
you
for
a light
to [the] gentiles
[that]
be
you
for
salvation
unto

a persecution
against

and
having shaken off
the

were
with

with

when
and 
came
an attempt
the
gentiles
[by] both
and
[the] Jews
with
the
rulers
of them
to mistreat
and
to stone

a certain

lame
from
[the] womb
of [the] mother
of him
who
never
walked
this one
heard
-
Paul
speaking
who
having gazed at
him
and
having seen
that
he has
faith
-
to be restored to health
he said
in a loud
voice
stand up
on
the
feet
of you
upright
and
he jumped up
and
was walking around
the
and 
crowds
having seen
what
did
Paul 
raised up
the
voice
of them
in the Lycaonian [dialect]
saying
the
gods
having been made like
men
came down
to
us
they were calling
and 
-
Barnabas
Zeus

and
Paul
Hermes
since
he

to offer a sacrifice
having heard [this]
but 
the
apostles
Barnabas
and
Paul
having torn
the
garments
of them
rushed out
into
the
crowd
crying out
and
saying
men
why
these things
are you doing 
also
we
of the same nature [as]
are
you
men
preaching
to you
from
these
-
worthless [things]
to turn
to
[the] living God
*
who
made
the
heaven
and
the
earth
and
the
sea
and
all
the things
in
them
who
in
the
having passed by
generations 
allowed
all
the
nations
to go
the
ways
of them
and
not
without witness
himself
did he leave
doing good
from heaven
to you
rains
giving 
and yet
seasons
of bearing fruit
filling
with food
and
with joy
the
hearts
of you
and
these things
saying
with difficulty
they restrained
the
crowds

not
to offer sacrifice
to them
came

from
Antioch
and
Iconium
Jews
and
having won over
the
crowds
and
having stoned
-
Paul
they were dragging [him]
outside
the
city
thinking
him
to have died
having surrounded  [after]
and
the
disciples
him
having arisen
he entered
into
the
city
and
on the
next day
he went out
with
-
Barnabas
to
Derbe
having preached the good news [in]
and ~
-
city
that 
and
having made disciples
many
they returned
to
-
Lystra
and
to
Iconium
and
to
Antioch
strengthening
the
souls
of the
disciples
encouraging [them]
to remain
in the
faith
and
that
through
many
tribulations
it is necessary
[for] us
to enter
into
the
kingdom
-
of God
having elected
and 
for them
in every
church
elders
having prayed
with
fastings
they commended
them
to the
Lord
in
whom
they had believed
and
having gone through
-
Pisidia
they came
to
-
Pamphylia
and
having spoken
in
Perga
the
word
they went down
to
Attalia
and from there
they sailed away
to
Antioch
from which
they had 
been commended
to the
grace
-
of God
to
the
work
which
they finished
~ having come
and ~
and
having assembled
the
church
they were reporting
what things
did
-
God
with
them
and
that
he opened
for the
gentiles
a door
of faith
they were spending
and ~
time
not
a little
with
the
disciples
and
some
having come down
from
-
Judea
were teaching
the
brothers
-
if
not
you are ~ circumcised
by the
custom
-
of Moses
not
you are ~ able
to be saved
~ having happened
now ~
a dispute
and
a debate
[of] no
little [proportion]
-
by Paul
and
-
Barnabas
with
them
they appointed
to go up
Paul
and
Barnabas
and
some
others
from
them
to
the
apostles
and
elders
in
Jerusalem
concerning
-
issue
this
-
-
then
having been sent on their way
by
the
church
they were passing through
-
both
Phoenicia
and
Samaria
telling in detail
the
conversion
of the
gentiles
and
they were bringing
great joy
*
to all
the
brothers
and having come
*
to
Jerusalem
they were received
by
the
church
and
the
apostles
and
the
elders
~ they reported
and ~
what things
-
God
did
with
them
but rose up
*
some
of the ones
from
the
sect
of the
Pharisees
having believed
saying
that
it is necessary
to circumcise
them
and to command [them]
*
to keep
the
law
of Moses
~ were gathered together
and
the
apostles
and
the
elders
to see
about
-
this matter
*
and [after] much
*
discussion
having taken place
having arisen
Peter
said
to
them
men
brothers
you
know
that
from
days
of old
among
you
chose
-
God
through
the
mouth
of me
to hear
the
gentiles
the
word
of the
good news
and
to believe
and
the
knower of hearts
God
bore witness
to them
having given
the
spirit
-
holy
just as
also
to us
and
he differentiated nothing
*
between
us
both
and
them
-
by faith
having cleansed
the
hearts
of them
therefore now
*
why
are you testing
-
God
to lay
a yoke
upon
the
neck
of the
disciples
which
neither
the
fathers
of us
nor
we
were able
to bear?
but
by
the
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
we believe
to be saved
as
in the 
same way
those also
was silent
and 
all
the
multitude
and
they were listening
to Barnabas
and
Paul
describing
what
did
-
God
signs
and
wonders
among
the
gentiles
through
them
after
and
-
kept silent
they
answered
James
saying
men
brothers
listen
to me
Simon
explained
how
first
-
God
concerned himself
to receive
from
[the] gentiles
a people
for the
name
of him
and
with this
is in agreement
the
words
of the
prophets
just as
it has been written
after
these things
I will return
and
I will rebuild
the
tent
of David
the one
having fallen
and
the things
having been torn down
of it
I will rebuild
and
I will restore
it
so that
might seek out
*
the ones
remaining
-
of men
the
Lord
and
all
the
gentiles
upon
whom
has been invoked
the
name
of me
over
them
says
[the] Lord
doing
these things
known
from
[the] ages
therefore
I
decide
not
to trouble
the ones
from
the
gentiles
turning
to
-
God
but
to write
to them
-
to keep away from
the
pollution
-
of idols
and
-
of sexual immorality
and
of the thing
strangled
and
-
of blood
for Moses
*
from
ancient generations
*
in every city
*
the ones
preaching
him
has
in
the
synagogues
on every
*
Sabbath
being read
then
it seemed [good]
to the
apostles
and
the
elders
with
[the] entire
-
church
having chosen
men
from
them
to send
to
Antioch
with
-
Paul
and
Barnabas
Judas
the one
being called
Barsabbas
and
Silas
leading men
*
among
the
brothers
having written
with
[the] hand
of them
the
apostles
and
the
elders
brothers
to the
throughout
-
Antioch
and
Syria
and
Cilicia
brothers
the ones
of
[the] gentiles
greetings
since
we heard
that
some
from
us
having come out
commanded
you
with words
unsettling
the
souls
of you
to whom
we did not give orders
*
it seemed [good]
to us
having become
of one mind
having chosen
men
to send
to
you
with
the
beloved
of us
Barnabas
and
Paul
men
having handed over
the
lives
of them
for
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
therefore we have sent
*
Judas
and
Silas
and
they
by
word [of mouth]
reporting
the
same things
for it seemed [good]
*
to the
spirit
-
holy
and
to us
no
more
to lay upon
you
burden
except
these
the
necessary things
to keep away from
meat sacrificed to idols
and
blood
and
strangled things
and
sexual immorality
from
which
keeping
yourselves
well
you will do 
good-bye
-
-
therefore
having been dismissed
they went down
to
Antioch
and
having gathered together
the
multitude
they delivered
the
letter
and having read [it]
*
they rejoiced
at
the
exhortation
Judas
both 
and
Silas
also
themselves
being prophets
*
with
words
many
comforted
the
brothers
and
strengthened [them]
and having spent
*
time
they were dismissed
with
peace
from
the
brothers
to
the ones
having sent
them
and Paul
*
and
Barnabas
were staying
in
Antioch
teaching
and
preaching
with
also
many others
*
the
word
of the
Lord
and after
*
some
days
said
to
Barnabas
Paul
having returned
then
let us visit
the
brothers
throughout
every city
*
in
which
we proclaimed
the
word
of the
Lord [to see]
how
they are
Barnabas
and 
was deciding
to take along
also
-
John
the one
being called
Mark
but Paul
*
was insisting
the one
having withdrawn
from
them
from
Pamphylia
and
not
having gone with
them
to
the
work
not
to take along
this one
and there was
*
a sharp disagreement
so that
they were separated
*
from
one another
-
and
Barnabas
having taken
-
Mark
to sail away
to
Cyprus
and Paul
*
having chosen
Silas
departed
having been commended
to the
grace
of the
Lord
by
the
brothers
they were traveling through
and
-
Syria
and
-
Cilicia
strengthening
the
churches
he arrived
and 
also
in
Derbe
and
in
Lystra
and
behold
disciple
a certain
was
there
by name
Timothy
[the] son
woman
Jewish
of a faithful
[whose] father [was]
but 
a Greek
who
was well spoken of
by
the
in
Lystra
and
Iconium
brothers
this one
wanted
-
Paul
with
him
to go out
and
having taken [him]
he circumcised
him
because of
the
Jews
-
being
in
-
those places
*
for had known
*
everyone
that
Greek
the
father
of him
was
and as
*
they were traveling through
the
cities
they were passing on
to them
to keep
the
commandments
-
having been decided
by
the
apostles
and
elders
-
in
Jerusalem
the
-
churches therefore
*
were growing
in the
faith
and
were increasing
-
in number
daily
*
and they traveled through
*
the
Phrygian
and
Galatian
country
having been prevented
by
the
holy
spirit
to speak
the
word
in
-
Asia
and having come
*
to
-
Mysia
they were trying
toward
-
Bithynia
to go
and
did not permit
*
them
the
spirit
of Jesus
and having passed through
*
-
Mysia
they came down
to
Troas
and
a vision
during
the
night
-
Appeared to Paul
*
man
Macedonian
a certain
had been standing
*
and
[was] begging
him
and
saying
having come over
to
Macedonia
help
us
and when
*
the
vision
he saw
immediately
he sought
to go out
to
Macedonia
concluding
that
has called
us
-
God
to preach the good news
to them
and having set sail
*
from
Troas
we ran a straight course
to
Samothrace
and on the
*
next day
to
Nea (polis)
Polis
and from there
to
Philippi
which
is
a prominent
of [the] district
-
of Macedonia
city
a colony
and we were
*
in
this
-
city
staying
some days
*
on the
and
day
of the
Sabbaths
we went out
outside
the
gate
beside
a river
where
we were supposing
[a place] of prayer
to be
and
having sat down
we were speaking
with the
women having assembled
*
and
a certain
woman
by name
Lydia
a dealer in purple cloth
of [the] city
of Thyatira
worshiping
-
God
was listening
of whom
the
Lord
opened
the
heart
to pay attention
to the things
being spoken
by
-
Paul
and when
*
she was baptized
and
the
house
of her
she begged [us]
saying
if
you have judged
me
faithful
to the
Lord
to be
having entered
into
the
house
of me
stay
and
she prevailed upon
us
and it came about
*
[when] we going
*
to
the
place of prayer [that]
slave girl
a certain
having
a spirit
of [the] python [came out]
to meet
us
who
profit
much
was bringing
to the
masters
of her [by]
prophesying
this one
following
-
Paul
and
us
was crying out
saying
these
-
men
slaves
of the
God
-
most high
are
who
are proclaiming
to you
[the] way
of salvation
and this
*
she was doing
for
many
days
but having become annoyed
*
Paul
and
having turned
to the
spirit
he said
I command
you
in
[the] name
of Jesus
Christ
to come out
from
her
and
it came out
in the same
*
hour
and having seen
*
the
masters
of her
that
went out
the
hope
of the
profit
of them
having seized
-
Paul
and
-
Silas
they dragged [them]
into
the
marketplace
before
the
authorities
and
having brought
them
to the
chief magistrates
they said
these
-
men
are disturbing
our
-
city
being Jews
*
and
they are proclaiming
customs
which
not
it is permitted
for us
to accept
nor
to do
being Romans
*
and
rose up together
the
crowd
against
them
and
the
chief magistrates
having torn off
their
-
garments
were commanding
to beat [them]
many
and
having inflicted upon
them
blows
they threw [them]
into
jail
having ordered
the
jailer
to guard securely
*
them
who
such an order
*
having received
threw
them
into
the
inner
jail
and
the
feet
of them he fastened
*
in
the
stock
and about
*
-
midnight
Paul
and
Silas [were]
praying [and]
were singing hymns
-
to God
and were listening to
*
them
the
prisoners
and suddenly
*
earthquake
there came
a great
so as
to be shaken
the
foundations
of the
Jail
and were opened
*
immediately
the
doors
all
and
of everyone
the
chains
were unfastened
and awake
*
having become
the
jailer
and
having seen
having been opened
the
doors
of the
jail
having drawn
the
sword
he was about
to kill himself
*
thinking
to have run away
the
prisoners
but shouted
*
with a loud
voice
-
Paul
saying
nothing [of]
do
to yourself
harm
all
for
we are
here
and having asked for
*
lights
he rushed in
and
trembling
having become
he fell down before
-
Paul
and
-
Silas
and
having led
them
outside
he said
sirs
what
is it necessary for me
*
to do
that
I may be saved?
-
and
they said
believe
on
the
Lord
Jesus
and
you will be saved
*
and
the
house
of you
and
they spoke
to him
the
word
of the
Lord
with
all
the ones
in
the
house
of him
and
having taken
them
in
that
-
hour
of the
night
he washed
from
the
wounds
and
he was baptized
*
and
the ones
of him
all
at once
and having led
*
them
to
the
house
he set before [them]
a table
and
he was overjoyed
with the whole household
having believed
-
in God
and day
*
having become
sent
the
magistrates
the
policemen
saying
release
-
those men
*
and reported
*
the
jailer
-
these words
*
to
-
Paul
-
have sent
the
magistrates
that
you may be released
now
therefore
having gone out
go
in
peace
-
but
Paul
said
to
them
having beaten
us
in public
uncondemned
Roman men
*
being
they threw [us]
into
jail
and
now
secretly
us
they are sending out?
no
indeed
but
having come
themselves
let them lead out us
*
and reported
*
to the
magistrates
the
policemen
-
these words
*
and they were afraid
*
having heard
that
they are Romans
*
and
having come
they begged
them
and
having brought [them] out
they were asking [them]
to depart
from
the
city
and having come out
*
from
the
jail
they came
to
-
Lydia
and
having seen [them]
they encouraged
the
brothers
and
went out
now having passed through
*
-
Amphipolis
and
-
Apollonia
they came
to
Thessalonica
where
there was
a synagogue
of the
Jews
and according to
*
the
custom
-
with Paul
he came
to
them
and
on
Sabbaths
three 
he preached
to them
from
the
scriptures
explaining
and
demonstrating
that
the
Christ
it was necessary [for]
to suffer
and
to rise
from
[the] dead
and
that
this one
is
the
Christ
-
Jesus
whom
I
am proclaiming
to you
and
some
of
them
were persuaded
and
were joined
-
to Paul
and
-
Silas
of the
both
worshiping
Greeks
multitude
a great 
women
and
of the
prominent
not
a few
having become jealous
and 
the
Jews
and
having taken
of the
people of the market
men
some
evil
and
having formed a mob
they were throwing into an uproar
the
city
and
having stood beside
the
house
of Jason
they were seeking
to bring them

to
the
crowd
not having found

but
them
they were dragging
Jason
and
some
brothers
to
the
city authorities
shouting

having troubled
these ones
and
here

Jason has received

and
all these ones

against
the
decrees
of Caesar

the
crowd
and
the
city authorities

these things
and
having taken
the
bond money
from

Jason
and
the
rest
they released
them

brothers
immediately
during
[the] night
sent out
-
both
Paul
and
-
Silas
to
Berea
who
having arrived
into
the
synagogue
of the
Jews
were going
these
but
were
more noble-minded [than]
the ones
in
Thessalonica
who
received
the
word
with
all
readiness
daily
*
examining
the
scriptures
if
might be
these things
so
many

therefore
of
them
believed
and
of the
Greek

prominent
and
men
not
a few [believed]
but when
*
realized
the

by

the
city
he was arguing
-
therefore
in
the
synagogue
with the
Jews
and
with the ones
worshiping
and
in
the
market place
every
*
day
to
the ones
happening to be there
some
and 
also
of the
Epicureans
and
Stoic
philosophers
were conversing
with him
and
some
were saying
what
might 
wish
-
babbler
this 
to say ?
others [said]
and 
of strange
deities
he seems
a proclaimer
to be
because
-
Jesus
and
the
resurrection
he was preaching
and having taken hold
*
of him
to
the
Areo (Pagus)
Pagus
they brought [him]
saying
are we able
to know
what
-
this new
*
-
by
you [is]
being spoken
teaching ?
surprising [things]
for
some
you bring
to
the
hearing
of us
therefore we desire
*
to know
what
wishes
these things
to mean
Athenians
now
all
and
the
strangers visiting
*
for
nothing
different
were finding opportunity
than
to say
something
or
to hear
something
newer
and having stood
*
-
Paul
in
[the] middle
of the
Areo (Pagus)
Pagus
he said
men
Athenians
with respect to
everything
how
very religious
I observe you [to be]
*
for passing through
*
and
looking carefully at
the
objects of worship
of you
I found
also
an altar
on
which
had been inscribed
to [the] unknown
God
therefore what
*
not knowing
you worship
this
I
proclaim
to you
-
God
the one
having made
the
world
and
all
the things
in
it
this one
of heaven
and
earth
being
Lord
not
in
temples made by human hands
*
dwells
nor
by
hands
human
is served [as if]
being in need
of something
he
giving
to all
life
and
breath
and
all these things
*
and he made
*
from
one
every
nation
of men
to dwell
on
all
[the] face
of the
earth
having set
[the] having been determined
seasons
and
the
fixed boundaries
of the
habitations
of them
to seek
-
God
if
perhaps
*
the might grope
for him
and
might find [him]
though
*
not
far
from
each one
*
of us
being
in
him
for
we live
and
move
and
are
as
also
some
of the
among
you
poets
have said
for of him
*
also
we are offspring
*
offspring
therefore
being
-
of God
we ought not
*
to think
with gold
or
silver
or
stone
an image formed
by [the]skill
and
thought
of man
the
divine
to be
like
so the
*
times then
*
-
of ignorance
having overlooked
-
God
-
now
he proclaims
-
to all men
*
everywhere
to repent
because
he set
a day
in
which
he is about
to judge
the
world
in
righteousness
by
a man
whom
he appointed
proof
having furnished 
to all [by]
having raised
him
from
[the] dead
and having heard [of]
*
[the] resurrection
of [the] dead
some
*
were mocking [him]
but others
*
said
we will listen to
you
about
this
also
again
thus
-
Paul
went out
from
[the] midst
of them
and some
*
men
having been joined
to him
believed
among
whom [are]
both
Dionysus
the
Areopagite
and
a woman
by name
Damaris
and
others
with
them
after
these things
having left
from
-
Athens
he came
to
Corinth
and
having found
some
Jews
by name
Aqeila
of Pontus
-
by birth
recently
having come
from
-
Italy
and
Priscilla
[the] wife
of him
because of
the thing
to have commanded
Claudius [that]
to leave
all
the
Jews
from
-
Rome
the approached
them
and
because of
the
same trade
to be
he was staying
with
them
and
he was working
they were
for
tent makers
-
by trade
and he was debating
*
in
the
synagogue
every
*
Sabbath
and he was convincing
*
Jews
and
Greeks
now when
-
came down
from
-
Macedonia
-
both
Silas
and
-
Timothy
was occupied with
the
word
-
Paul
testifying
to the
Jews
to be
the
Christ
Jesus
opposing
but
[when] they
and
blaspheming
having shaken out
the
garments
he said
to
them
the
blood
of you [be]
upon
the
head
of you
clean
I [am]
from
-
now [on]
to
the
Gentiles
I will go
and
having passed over
from there
he entered
into
[the] house
of a certain man
by name
Titius
Justus
worshiping
-
God
whose
-
house
was bordering on
*
the
synagogue
and Crispus
*
the
synagogue leader
believed
in the
Lord
with
[the] entire
-
house
of him
and
many
of the
Corinthians
hearing
were believing
and
were being baptized
and said
*
the
Lord
in
[the] night
through
a vision
-
to Paul
do not fear
*
but
speak
and
do not keep silent
*
for
I
am
with
you
and
no one
will attack
you
-
to harm
you
for
people
it is
to me
many
in
-
this city
*
and he sat
*
a year
and
six months
*
teaching
among
them
the
word
-
of God
and Gallio
*
being proconsul
*
-
of Achaia
rose up
with one accord
the
Jews [against]
-
Paul
and
they brought
him
before
the
judgment seat
saying
-
against
the
law
the one persuades
*
-
men
to worship
-
God
being about
and
-
Paul
to open
the
mouth
spoke
-
Gallio
to
the
Jews
if
-
it was
some wrong
*
or
evil crime
*
O
Jews
reasonably
*
I might put up with
*
you
if
but
questions
it is 
about
a word
and
names
and
law
-
-
your
you will see [to it for]
yourselves
a judge
I 
of these things
not 
do intend
to be
and
he drove away
them
from
the
judgment seat
having seized
but
everyone
Sosthenes
the
synagogue leader
they were beating [him]
before
the
judgment seat
and
none
of these things
-
to Glallio
was a concern
-
but
Paul
still
having remained
a number of days
*
to the
brothers
having said good bye
he was sailing away
to
-
Syria
and
with
him
Priscilla
and
Aquila
having shaved
in
Cenchea
the (his)
head
for he had [taken]
*
a vow
and they arrived
*
in
Ephesus
and those
he left
there
but he
*
having entered
into
the
synagogue
debated with
the
Jews
asking (him)
and
[when] they
for
a longer
time
to stay
he did not give his consent
he did not give his consent
but
having said good bye
and
having said
I will return again
*
to
you
-
God
willing
he set sail
from
-
Ephesus
and
having come down
to
Caesarea
and having gone up
and
having greeted
the
church
he went down
to
Antioch
and
having spent
some time
*
he went out
passing through
in order
the
Galatian
country
and
Phrygia
strengthening
all
the
disciples
Jew
now
a certain
Apollos
by name
Analexandrian
-
by birth
a learned man
*
arrived
in
Ephesus
strong
being 
in
the
scriptures
this one
had been taught
*
the
way
of the
Lord
and
burning
-
in spirit
the was speaking
and
teaching
accurately
the things
about
-
Jesus
being acquainted with
only
the
baptism
of John
and this one
*
began
to speak boldly
in
the
synagogue
and having heard
*
him
Priscilla
and
Aquilla
took
him
and
more accurately
to him
explained
the
way
-
of God
and desiring
*
he
to go
to
-
Achaia
having been encouraged
the
brothers
wrote
to the
disciples
to welcome
him
who
having come
he helped
greatly
the ones
having believed
through
-
grace
for powerfully
*
the
Jews
he was refuting
in public
showing
through
the
scriptures
to be
the
Christ
Jesus
and it came about
*
while
*
-
Apollos
was
in
Corinth
Paul
having traveled through
the
upper
regions
to come down
to
Ephesus
and
to find
some
disciples
and he said
*
to
them
if
[the] holy spirit
*
you received
having believed?
they
but
[said] to
him
but
not even
whether
spirit
a holy
there is
we heard
and he said
*
into
what
then
were you baptized ?
-
and
they said
into
the
Baptism of John
*
and said
*
Paul
John
baptized [with]
a baptism
of repentance
to the
people
saying
in
the one
coming
after
him
that
they should believe
this
means
in
-
Jesus
and having heard [this]
*
they were baptized
in
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
and
having placed upon
them
-
Paul
the (his)
hands
came
the
spirit
-
holy
upon
them
and they were speaking
*
tongues
and
were prophesying
and were
*
all the
*
men
about
twelve
and having entered
*
into
the
synagogue
he was speaking boldly
over
three months
*
debating
and
persuading
concerning the things
*
of the
kingdom
-
of God
but when
*
some
were being hardened
and
were disobeying
speaking evil of
the
way
before
the
multitude
having withdrawn
from
them
he took
the
disciples
daily
*
debating
in
the
school
of Tyrannus
and this
*
happened
over
two years
*
so that
all
the ones
inhabiting
-
Asia
to hear
the
word
of the
Lord
Jews
both ~ 
and
Greeks
and miracles
*
not
the ones
having commonly occurred
-
God
performed
by
the
hands
of Paul
so that
also
upon
the ones
being sick
to be taken away
from
the
skin
of him
handkerchiefs
or
aprons
and
to be taken away
from
them
the
diseases
and the
*
spirits
-
evil
to go out
and ~ attempted
and ~ attempted
also ~ some
*
of the ones
going around
Jewish
exorcists
to name
over
the ones
having

spirits

evil
the
name
ones
Lord
Jesus
saying
I command
you [by]
-
Jesus
whom
Paul
preaches
and there were
*
of a certain
Sceva
a Jewish
chief priest
seven
sons
doing this
*
having answered
and 
the
spirit
-
evil
said
to them
-
Indeed
Jesus
I know
and [with]
-
Paul
I am acquainted
but you
*
who
are you ?
and
having leaped
the
man
upon
them
in
whom
was
the
spirit
-
evil
having subdued
all
he overpowered
against
them
so that
naked
and
having been wounded
to flee
from
-
that house
*
and this
*
became
known
to all
[the] Jews
and
also
[the] Greeks
-
inhabiting
-
Ephesus
and
fear fell
*
upon
all
of them
and
they were exalting
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
and many
*
of the ones
having believed
were coming
confessing
and
disclosing
the
actions
of them
and a number
*
of the ones
-
having practiced magic
*
having brought together
the
books
were burning [them]
before
everyone
and
they added up
the
price
of them
and
they  found [it to be]
of silver
fifty thousand [pieces]
*
so
powerfully
*
of the
Lord
the
word
was growing
and
was becoming strong
* when
* and
were fulfilled
these things
resolved
-
Paul
in
the (his)
spirit
having traveled through
-
Macedonia
and
Achaia
to go
to
Jerusalem
having said
-
after
-
coming to be
* me
there
it is necessary
for me
also
Rome
to see
and having sent
*
to
-
Macedonia
two
of the ones
serving
with him
Timothy
and
Erastus
he
stayed
a while
in
-
Asia
now there was
*
during
-
that time
*
disturbance
no
small
concerning
the
way
Demetrius
for
a certain one
by name
a silversmith
making
silver shrines
*
of Artemis
was providing
for the
craftsmen
no
small
profit
whom
having assembled
also
the
occupied with
-
such things
workmen
he said
men
you know
that
from
this
-
trade
-
prosperity
to us
is
and
you see
and
hear
that
not
only
of Ephesus
but [in]
almost
all
-
of Asia
-
this Paul
*
having persuaded [some]
turned away
a large
crowd
saying
that
are not
*
gods
the things
with
hands
being made
not
only
and
this
is a danger
to us
the
part
into
disrepute
to come
but
also
the
of the
great
goddess
Artemis
temple
as
nothing
to be considered
to be about
and 
also
to suffer [the] loss
of the
majesty
of her
which
all
-
Asia
and
the
world
worship
and having listened
*
and
having become
full
of anger
they were crying out
saying
great [is]
-
Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
and
was filled
the
city
-
with confusion
and they rushed
*
with one impulse
into
the
theater
having seized
Gaius
and
Aristarchus
Macedonians
traveling companions
of Paul
and Paul
*
desiring
to enter
into
the
assembly
were not allowing
*
him
the
disciples
some
and 
also
of the
Asiarchs
being
to him
friends
having sent
to
him
were begging [him]
not
to give
himself
to
the
theater
others
-
then
different
something 
were crying out
had
for 
the
assembly
been confused
and
the
majority
had not
known
why
*
they had assembled
and from
*
the
crowd
they prompted
Alexander
having brought forward
him
the
Jews
-
and
Alexander
having waved
the (his)
hand
was wanting
to defend himself
to the
assembly
but having known
*
that
he is a Jew
*
voice
there was
one
from
everyone
for about
*
two hours
*
crying out
great [is]
-
Artemis
of [the] Ephesians
having restrained
and
the
town clerk
the
crowd
says
men
Ephesians
who
indeed
is there
of men
who
does not know
*
the
Ephesians
city [as]
* [the] guardian of the temple
* being
of the
great
Artemis
and
of the [image]
fallen from heaven?
undeniable
therefore
being
these things
it is necessary
*
for you
having become calm
to be
and
nothing
reckless
to do
for you brought
*
-
these men [here]
*
neither
temple robbers
nor
blaspheming
the
god
of us
if
-
therefore
Demetrius
and
the
with
him
craftsmen
have
against
anyone
a complaint
courts
are in session
and
there are proconsuls
*
let them bring charges against
one another
and if
*
anything
further
you seek
in
the
lawful
assembly
it will be settled
for indeed
*
we are in danger
to be charged with
an uprising
concerning
-
today
nothing
of a reason
being
about
which
not 
we will be able
to render
an account
concerning
-
this commotion
*
and
these things
having said
he dismissed
the
assembly
and after
*
-
had ended
the
uproar
having summoned
-
Paul
the
disciples
and
having exhorted [them] [and]
having said good bye
he departed
to go
to
Macedonia
and having traveled through
*
-
those regions
*
and
having exhorted
them
with many word[s]
*
he came
to
-
Greece
and having spent
*
three months [there]
*
having become
a plot
against him
by
the
Jews
being about
to set sail
for
-
Syria
he was
of a mind
-
to return
through
Macedonia
were accompanying
and 
him
Sopater
[the son] of Pyrrhus
[the] Berean
of [the] Thessalonians
and
Aristarchus
and
Secundus
and
Gaius
of Derbe
and
Timothy
[the] Asians
and 
Tychicus
and
Trophimus
these
and 
having gone ahead
were waiting
for us
in
Troas
we
and 
sailed away
after
the
days
of the
unleavened  bread [feast]
from
Philippi
and
we came
to
them
in
-
Troas
within
days
five 
where
we stayed
days
seven 
and on
*
-
one
of the
Sabbaths
having been assembled
us
to break
bread
-
Paul
was lecturing
them
being about
to depart
on the
next day
and was extending
*
the
message
until
midnight
there were
and 
of lamps
a number 
in
the
upper story
where
we had 
assembled
and sitting
*
a certain
young man
by name
Eutychus
on
the
window [sill]
being overcome
by a deep sleep
*
lecturing
-
Paul
for
a long [time]
having been overcome
from
-
sleep
he fell
from
the
third story
downwards
and
was picked up
dead
and having come down
*
-
Paul
fell upon
him
and
having embraced [him]
he said
not
do be troubled
for the
*
life
of him
in
him
is
and having gone up
*
and
having broken
the
bread
and
having partaken [of it]
for
a considerable [time]
and
having spoken
until
dawn
thus
he departed
and they led away
*
the
young man
living
and
they were comforted
not
moderately
we
and 
having gone ahead
to
the
boat
set sail
for
-
Assos
from there
intending
to take along
-
Paul
thus
for 
arranged it
he had 
intending
himself
to travel by land
and when
*
he was meeting
us
in
-
Assos
having taken along
him
we came
to
Mitylene
and from there
having sailed away
on the
next [day]
we arrived
opposite
Chios
and on the
*
next [day]
we crossed over
to
Samos
and on the
*
following [day]
we came
to
Miletus
had decided
for 
-
Paul
to sail past
-
Ephesus
so as
not
it would be
to him
to spend time
in
-
Asia
he was hurrying
for 
if
possible
it might be
to him
the
day
-
of Pentecost
to come
in
Jerusalem
and from
*
-
Miletus
having sent
to
Ephesus
he summoned
the
elders
of the
church
and when
*
they came
to
him
he said
to them
you
know
from
[the] first
day
from
which
I set foot
in
-
Asia
how
with
you
the
entire
time
I was
serving
the
Lord
with
all
humility
and
tears
and
trials
-
having happened
to me
by
the
plots
of the
Jews
how
nothing
I kept back
of the things
being profitable
-
not
to disclose
to you
and
to teach
you
in public
and
from house to house
*
testifying
to Jews
both
and
Greeks
-
toward
God
repentance
and
faith
in
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
and
now
behold
I having been bound
*
by the
spirit
am going
to
Jerusalem
the things
in
it
going to happen
to me
not
having known
except
that
the
spirit
-
holy
in every city
*
testifies
to me
saying
that
bounds
and
tribulations
are waiting for me
*
but
of no
account
do I make
the (my)
life
valuable
to myself
so as
to finish
the
course
of me
and
the
ministry
which
I received
from
the
Lord
Jesus
to bear witness to
the
good news
of the
grace
-
of God
and
now
behold
I
know
that
no longer
will you see
the
face
of me
all of you
*
among
whom
I went about
preaching
the
kingdom
therefore
I testify
to you
on
[this very]
~ today
day ~
that
I am innocent
*
of
the
blood
of all
for I did not shrink back from
*
*
-
not
to disclose
all
the
will
-
of God
to you
pay attention
to yourselves
and
to all
the
flock
in
which
you
the
spirit
-
holy
placed [as]
overseers
to shepherd
the
church
-
of God
which
he purchased
with
-
blood
-
his own
I
know
that
will come in
after
the
departure
of me
savage wolves
*
among
you
not
sparing
the
flock
and
from
you
yourselves
will rise up
men
speaking [things]
having been perverted
-
to draw away
the
disciples
after
them
therefore
be alert
having remembered
that
three years
night
and
day
not
I did stop
with
tears
admonishing
each one [of you]
*
and
-
now
I commend
you
-
to God
and
to the
word
of the
grace
of him
-
being able
to build
and
to give
the
inheritance
among
the ones
having been sanctified
all
silver
or
gold
or
[the] clothing
of no one
did I long for
yourselves
you know
that
for the
needs
of me
and
the ones
being
with
me
served
these
hands
*
everything
I showed
to you
that
thus
working hard
it is necessary
to help
the
weak
and to remember
*
the
words
of the
Lord
Jesus
that
he said himself
*
blessed
it is
more
to give
than
to receive
and
these things
having said
having bent
the
knees
of him
with
them all
*
he prayed
and much
*
crying
there was
of everyone
and
having fallen
upon
the
neck
-
of Paul
they were kissing
him
grieving
above all
at
the
word
in which
he had said
that
no longer
they were about
the
face
of him
to see
and they were accompanying
*
him
to
the
boat
when
and 
it came about [that]
set sail
we 
having parted
from
them
having run a straight course
we came
to
-
Cos
on the
and 
next [day]
to
-
Rhodes
and from there
to
Patria
and
having found
a boat
crossing over
to
Phoenicia
having embarked
we set sail
and having come within sight
*
-
of Cyprus
and
having left behind
it
on the left
we were sailing
to
Syria
and
we arrived
in
Trye
for there
*
the
boat
was unloading
*
the
cargo
[after] having searched for
and
the
disciples
we stayed
there
days
seven
who
-
Paul
were telling
by
the
spirit
not
to go up
to
Jerusalem
but when
*
it came about
to be finished for us
*
the
days
having gone out
we were going
accompanying
us
everyone
with
wives
and
children
as far as
outside
the
city
and
having bent
the
knees
on
the
beach
having prayed
we said good-bye
to one another
and
we embarked
into
the
boat
and those ones
*
returned
to
-
their own [homes]
and we
*
the
voyage
having completed
from
Trye
arrived
in
Ptolemais
and
having greeted
the
brothers
we stayed
one day
*
with
them
and on the
*
next day
having gone out
we came
to
Caesarea
and
having entered
into
the
house
of Philip
the
Evangelist
being [one]
of
the
seven
we stayed
with
him
to this one
and 
there were
daughters
four 
virgins
prophesying
and remaining
*
many days
*
came down
a certain one
from
the
Jews
a prophet
by name
Agabus
and
having come
to
us
and
having taken
the
belt
-
of Paul
having bound
of himself
the
feet
and
the
hands
he said
these things
says
the
spirit
-
holy
the
man
of whom
is
-
this belt
*
thus
will bind
in
Jerusalem
the
Jews
and
will deliver [him]
into
[the] hands
of [the] Gentles
and when
*
we heard
these things
we were begging [him]
both we
*
and
the
local residents
-
not
to go up
him
to
Jerusalem
then
answered
-
Paul
what
are you doing
weeping
and
breaking
my
-
heart?
for I
*
not
only
to be bound
but
also
to die
in
Jerusalem
am prepared
*
for
the
name
of the
Lord
Jesus
not
persuading
and
him
we remained silent
having said
of the
Lord
the
will
let be [done]
and after
*
-
these days
*
having made preparations
we were going up
to
Jerusalem
traveled
and 
also [some]
of the
disciples
from
Caesarea
with
us
bringing [one]
with
whom
we might stay
Mnason
a certain
a Cyprian
long standing
a disciple of 
having come
and 
us
to
Jerusalem
gladly
welcomed
us
the
brothers
and on the
*
following [day]
was going in
-
Paul
with
us
to
James
and all
*
came
the
elders
and
having greeted
them
he was explaining
one by one
*
*
of what [things]
did
-
God
among
the
Gentiles
through
the
ministry
of him
and the ones
*
having heard
were glorifying
*
God
and they said
*
to him
you see
brother
how many
thousands
there are
among
the
Jews
-
having believed
and
all
zealots
of the
law
are
and they were informed
*
about
you
that
you teach apostasy
*
from
Moses
the ones [living]
among
the
Gentiles
all
Jews
telling
not
to circumcise
them
the (their)
children
nor
in the
customs
to walk
what
then
is to be [done]?
certainly
they will hear
that
you have come
this
therefore
do
which
we tell you
*
there are
with us
four men
*
having a vow
*
upon
themselves
having taken these
*
purify yourself
with
them
and
spend [money]
on
them
that
they will shave
the (their)
head(s)
and
everyone will know
*
that
of which
they have been informed
about
you
there is nothing
*
but
you are agreement
also
yourself [with]
keeping
the
law
concerning
and 
the
having believed
Gentiles
we
wrote
having decided [that]
avoid
they 
the
both 
meat offered to idols
and
blood
and
strangled [things]
and
sexual immorality
then
-
Paul
having taken
the
men
on the
following
day
with
them
having been purified
he was entering
into
the
temple
giving notice of
the
completion
of the
days
of the
purification
until
*
was offered
for
each one
*
of them
the
offering
now when
*
were about
the
seven
days
to be completed
the
from
-
Asia
Jews
having seen
him
in
the
temple
were stirring up
all
the
crowd
and
they laid
on
him
the (their)
hands
crying out
men
Israelites

in addition
and
also
Greeks
he brought 
into

for they had previously seen

*
Trophimus
the
Ephesian
in
the
city
with
him
whom
they were supposing
that
into
the
temple
brought
-
Paul
was aroused
and
the
whole city
*
and
there was
a running together
of the
people
and
having seized
-
Paul
they were dragging
him
outside
the
temple
and
immediately
were shut
the
doors
and [while] seeking
*
to kill him
*
a report went up
*
to the
commander
of the
cohort
that
all
Jerusalem is in confusion
*
who
at once
having taken
soldiers
and
centurions
ran down
to
them
-
and
having seen
the
commander
and
the
soldiers
they stopped
beating
-
Paul
then
having come near
the
commander
took hold
of him
and
ordered [him]
to be bound
with two chains
*
and
he was inquiring
who
he might be
and
what
he has done
*
and others
*
something different
*
were shouting
in
the
crowd
not
being able
and
he
to know
-
something definite
because of
the
noise
ordered
him to be brought
*
into
the
barracks
and when

he was
on
the
steps
it came about [that]
is carried
he 
by
the
soldiers
because of
the
violence
of the
crowd
were following
for 
the
multitude
of the
people
crying out
take away
him!
and being about
*
to be brought
into
the
barracks
-
Paul
says
to the
commander
if
it is permissible
for me
to say
something
to
you?
-
and
he said
do you know Greek?
*
not
then
you
are
the
Egyptian
-
before
these
-
days
having raised a revolt
and
having led out
into
the
desert
the
four thousand
men
of the
Assasins?
and said
*
-
Paul
I
a man
-
am
a Jew [from]
Tarsus
-
of Cilicia
not
of an insignificant
city
a citizen
and I ask
*
you
allow
me
to speak
to
the
people
having permitted [it]
and
he
-
Paul
having stood
on
the
steps
motioned
with the (his)
hand
to the
People
a Great
and 
silence
having come
he addressed [them]
in the
Hebrew
language
saying
men
brothers
and
fathers
listen
to my
-
to
you
now
defense
and having heard
*
that
in the
Hebrew
language
he was addressing
them
they became even more
*
quiet
and
he says
I
am
a man
Jewish 
having been born
in
Tarsus
-
of Cilicia
having been brought up
but 
in
-
city
this 
at
the
feet
of Gamaliel
having been educated
according to
[the] strictness
of the
our fathers
law
zealous
being 
-
for God
just as
all
you
are
today
who
this

way
persecuted
[even] to
death
binding
and
delivering
to
jail
men
both
and
women
even as
*
the
high priest
testifies
to me
and
all
the
council of elders
from
whom
also
letters
having received
to
the
brothers
in
Damascus
I was going
leading away
also
the ones
there
being
having been bound
to
Jerusalem
that
they might be punished
and it happened
*
to me
[while] traveling
and
drawing near
-
to Damascus
about
midday
suddenly
from
-
heaven
to shine
a very bright light
*
around
me
I fell
and 
to
the
ground
and
I heard
a voice
saying
to me
Saul
Saul
why
me
are you persecuting?
and I
*
answered
who
are you
Lord?
and he said
*
to
me
I
am
Jesus
the
Nazarene
whom
you
are persecuting
and the ones
*
with
me
being
the
-
light
saw
but the
*
voice
not 
they did hear
-
speaking
to me
and I said
*
what
may I do
Lord?
and the
*
Lord
said
to
me
having arisen
go
into
Damascus
and there
to you
it will be told
about
everything
which
has been appointed
for you
to do
and because
*
I was not seeing
*
from
the
glory
-
of that light
*
being led by the hand
by
the ones
being with
me
I came
into
Damascus
Ananias
and
A certain
a devout man
*
according to
the
law
being well spoken of
by
all
the
Jews living [there]
*
having come
to
me
and
having stood by
he said
to me
Saul
brother 
receive your sight
and I
this
-
hour
looked up
at
him
-
and
he said
the
God
of the
fathers
of us
appointed
you
to know
the
will
of him
and
to see
the
righteous one
and
to hear
a call
from
the
mouth
of him
because
you will be
a witness
to him
to
all
men
of what
you have seen
and
heard
and
now
what
do you intend [to do]?
having arisen
be baptized
and
wash away
the
sins
of you
having called upon
the
name
of him
it happened
and 
to me
having returned
to
Jerusalem
and
[as] was praying
I
in
the
temple [that]
came to be
I ~
in
a trance
and
to see
him
saying
to me
hurry
and
get out
*
quickly
from
Jerusalem
because
they
will not receive
your
testimony
concerning
me
and I
said
Lord
they know themselves
*
that
I
was imprisoning
*
and
beating
throughout
the
synagogues
the ones
believing
on
you
and
when
was being poured out
the
blood
of Stephen
the
witness
of you
also
myself
standing [by]
I had been 
and
agreeing
and
protecting
the
garments
of the ones
killing
him
and
he said
to
me
go
because
I
to
[the] Gentiles
far away
I will send out
you
and they were listening
*
to him
up to
this
-
word
and
they lifted up
the
voice
of them
saying
take away
from
the
earth
-
such a one
for it was not fitting
*
*
for him
to live
and crying out
*
they
and
throwing off
the (their)
garments
and
throwing dust
*
into
the
air
ordered
the
commander
to be brought
him
into
the
barracks
having said
with whips
to be examined
him
that
he may know
for
what
reason
they were shouting thus
*
to him
and when
*
they stretched out
him
with the
straps
said
to
the
centurion having stood [by]
*
-
Paul
if
a man [is]
a Roman
and
uncondemned
it is lawful
for you
to whip [him] ?
and having heard [this]
*
the
centurion
having approached
the
commander
reported
saying
what
are you about
to do?
-
for
this man
*
is a Roman
*
and having approached
*
the
commander
said
to him
tell
me
you
a Roman
are?
-
and
he said
Yes
and answered
*
the
commander
I [with]
a large
sum of money
-
this citizenship
*
acquired
-
and
Paul
said
but I
*
indeed
have been born [a citizen]
immediately
then
withdrew
from
him
the ones
being about
to examine him
*
also
the
commander
and
he was afraid
having learned
that
a Roman
he is 
and
that
him
he had 
bound
and on the
*
next day
desiring
to know
-
something definite
-
why
he is accused
by
the
Jews
he released
him
and
ordered
to be assembled
the
chief priests
and
all
the
council
and
having brought down
-
Paul
he set [him]
before
them
and having gazed

Paul
at the

the ones
and
having stood [by]
said
the

made known

requesting
against

I answered
that
not
it is
a custom
with Romans

the one
being accused
face to face

should have
the
accusers
an opportunity [for]

they
here
delay

having been standing

no

I
was suspecting
Evil things

but
certain
about

about

Jesus
having died

to live

about

was saying
if
he might wish

Paul
having appealed [that]

for

King Agrippa

and
all
the
being present together
with us
men
you see
this one
about
whom
all
the
multitude
of the
Jews
appealed
to me
in
both
Jerusalem
and
here
crying out [that]
it is not fitting for
*
him
to live
any longer
I
but 
found
nothing
worthy
him
of death
to have done
himself
but 
this one
having appealed to
the
emperor
I decided
to send [him]
about
whom
definite
something 
to write
to the
Lord
I do not have
*
therefore
I brought forward
him
before
you
and
above all
before
you
king
Agrippa
so that
the
investigation
having happened
I may have
something
I may write
for unreasonable
*
it seems to me
*
sending
a prisoner
not
also
the
against
him
charges
to report
and Agrippa
*
to
-
Paul
said
it is permitted
for you
concerning
yourself
to speak
then
-
Paul
having stretched out
the (his)
hand
was making his defense
concerning
everything
of which
I am being accused
by
[the] Jews
King
Agrippa
I have considered
myself
fortunate
before
you
intending
today
to make my defense
most of all
an expert
being
you
of all

of
[the] Jews
customs
both
and
issues
therefore
I beg [you]
patiently
to listen to
me
the
so
then
manner of life
of me
-
from [my]
youth
-
from
[the] beginning
having been
in
the
nation
of me
and in
*
Jerusalem
have known
all
the
Jews
previously knowing
me
for a long time
if
they are willing
to testify
that
according to
the
most strict
sect
-
of our
religion
I lived [as]
a Pharisee
and
now
on
[the] hope
of the
to
the
fathers
of us
promise
having been made
by
-
God
I have stood
being judged
to
which
the
twelve tribes
of us
with
earnestness
night
and
day
worshiping
hopes
to attain
about
which
hope
I am being accused
by
[the] Jews
[O] king
why
unbelievable
is it considered 
by
you
if
-
God
raises [the] dead?
*
I
-
therefore
thought
to myself
against
the
name
of Jesus
the
Nazarene
it is necessary
many
hostile things
to do
which
also
I did
in
Jerusalem
and
many
-
of the
saints
I
in
jails
locked up

from
the
chief priests
authority
having received
being killed
and
they
I cast
a vote
and
throughout
all
the
synagogues
often
punishing
them
I was forcing [them]
to blaspheme
and even more
*
being enraged
at them
I was persecuting
as far as
even
to
the
cities outside
*
in
which
traveling
to
-
Damascus
with
authority
and
permission
-
of the
chief priests [at]
mid day
*
along
the
way
I saw
[o] king
from heaven
beyond
the
brilliance
of the
Sun
having shone around
me
a light
and
the ones
with
me
traveling
and all
*
of us having fallen down
*
to
the
ground
I heard
a voice
saying
to
me
in the
Hebrew
language
Saul
Saul
why
are you persecuting me?
*
[it is] hard
for you
against
[the] prod
to kick
and I
*
said
who
are you
Lord ?
and the
*
Lord
said
I
am
Jesus
whom
you
are persecuting
but
get up
and
stand
on
the
feet
of you
for
this [purpose]
then
I appeared
to you
to appoint
you
a servant
and
witness
[things in] which
both of
you saw
me
and the [things in] which
*
I will appear
to you
delivering
you
from
the
people
and
from
the
Gentiles
to
whom
I
am sending
you
to open
[the] eyes
of them

to turn [them]
from
[the] darkness
to
[the] light
and
the
authority

of Satan
to
-
God [that]
-
receive
they
forgiveness
of sins
and
a share
among
the ones
having been sanctified
by faith
-
in
me
from which
King
Agrippa
I was not

disobedient
to the
heavenly
vision
but
to the ones
in
Damascus
first
and
also
in Jerusalem
and all
*
the
region
-
of Judea
and
to the
Gentiles
I was announcing
to repent
and
to turn
to

God
worthy

of repentance

doing
because
of these things
me
[the] Jews
having seized

in

temple

having obtained

from

God
up to

day
this 
I have stood
witnessing
to small
both

great
nothing
except
saying
what things
both
the

said
being about
to happen
and
Moses
if
subject to suffering
the
Christ

first
by
a resurrection
of [the] dead
a light
is about
to announce
both to the

people

Festus

voice
says
you are insane
Paul
the
greatness of
your
learning
to
insanity
is turning [you]

but
Paul
I am not insane

he says
most excellent
Festus

about

him

I know
that
you believe

and
Agrippa [said]
to

Paul
in
a little [while]
you are persuading me

Paul

it is necessary

to run aground

[the] fourteenth
night

in

toward
[the] middle
of the
night

into

said
-
Paul
to the
centurion
and
to the
soldiers
unless

these
remain
in

Then
cut off
the
soldiers
the
ropes
of the
lifeboat
and
let
it
fall away
now until

day
was about
to come
was encouraging

Paul
everyone
to take
food
saying
today [is] [the] fourteenth

waiting
without eating
you are continuing

Therefore
I encourage
you

these things

bread
he gave thanks

before
all

having broken [it]
he began
to eat

and
having become
everyone
also
they 
took
food
now were
*
all the
*
souls
in
the
ship
two hundred and seventy six
*
*
and having eaten enough
*
food
they were lightening
the
ship
[by] throwing overboard
the
wheat
into
the
sea
and when
*
it became day
*
the
land
they were recognizing
*
bay
but
a certain
they were not noticing
having
a shore
onto
which
they were desiring
if
they might be able
to run aground
the
ship
and
the
anchors
having cast off
they were leaving
in
the
sea
at the same time
having loosened
the
ropes
of the
rudders
and
having raised
the
sail
to the
breeze
they were steering
toward
the
shore
but having fallen
*
into
a place
between two seas
they ran aground
the
ship
and
while the
*
bow
having stuck
remained
immovable
the
-
stern
was being destroyed
by
the
force
of the
waves
of the
now
soldiers
[the] plan
was
that
the
prisoners
they should kill
lest
anyone
having swum away
should escape
but the
*
centurion
desiring
to save
-
Paul
kept
them [from carrying out]
the
plan
and he ordered
*
the ones
being able
to swim
having thrown themselves [overboard]
first
upon
the
land
to go out
and
the
rest
some
*
on
boards
others
*
on
some
of the things
from
the
ship
and
so
it came about
everyone
to be brought safely
onto
the
land
and
having been brought safely through,
then
we found out
that
Malta
the
island
is called
and the
*
foreigners
were showing
not
the
ordinary
kindness
to us
for having lit
*
a fire
they welcomed
us all
*
because of
the
rain
-
having set in
and
because of
the
cold
and having gathered
*
-
Paul
of sticks
a certain
number
and
having placed [them]
on
the
fire
a viper
from
the
heat
having come out
fastened onto
the
hand
of him
and when
*
saw
the
foreigners
hanging
the
creature
from
the
hand
of him
to
one another
they were saying
surely
is a murderer
*
-
this man

Gentiles

by nature
the things

these

for

if

what
then?
do we excel?
not
at all;

for~
Jews

and

all
under
sin
to be,
as
it has been written,
-
there is~not

a grave
having been opened
[is] the
throat
of them,
with the
tongues
of them
they were working deceit,
poison
of asps
[is] under
the
lips
of them;
whose
-
mouth
of cursing
and
bitterness
is full,
swift [are]
the
feet
of them
to shed
blood,
ruin

paths
of them,
and
[the] way

they did not know.
*
not
there is ~
a fear
of God
before
the
eyes
of them.
but~we know
*
that
whatever
the
law
says
to the ones
in (under)
the
law
it speaks,
that
every
mouth
may be stopped
and
under judgment
may come
all
the
world
-
by God;
because
by
works
of law
not
will be justified
all
flesh
before
him,
through
for~
law
[is] full recognition
of sin.
but~now
*
apart from
law
a righteousness
of God
has been manifested,
being attested to
by
the
law
and
the
prophets,
a righteousness
-
of God
through
faith
of (in) Jesus
Christ
to
all
the ones
believing.
no
for
there is
distinction,
for~all
*
sinned
and
come short
of the
glory
-
of God,
being justified
freely
-
by his
grace
through
the
redemption
-
in
Christ
Jesus;
whom
displayed
-
God
[as] a propitiation
through
-
faith
in
-
his
blood
for
a display
of the
righteousness
of him
because of
the
passing by
of the
having previously occurred
sins
in
the
forbearance
-
of God,
for
the
display
of the
righteousness
of him
in
the
present
time,
for
-
~to be
him
just
and
justifying
the one
of
faith
of (in) Jesus.
where
therefore
[is] the
boasting?
it was excluded.
through
what
principle?
-
of works?
no,
but
through
a principle
of faith.
for~we consider
*
to be justified
by faith
a man
apart from
works
of law.
or
of Jews
[is he] the
God
only?
not
also
of Gentiles?
yes
also
of Gentiles,
since
one
-
God
[there is] who
will justify
[the] circumcision
by
faith
and
uncircumcision
through
-
faith.
[the] law
therefore
do we annul
through
-
faith?
never
may it ~ be.
rather
[the] law
we confirm.
what
then
will we say
to have discovered
Abraham
the
forefather
of us
according to
flesh?
if
for~
Abraham
by
works
was justified,
he has
a boast,
but
not
toward
God.
for~what
*
the
scripture
says?
believed
and
Abraham
-
God,
and
it was accounted
to him
for
righteousness.
now~to the one
*
working
the
reward
not
is accounted
according to
grace
but
according to
debt,
but~to the one
*
not
working
but~believing
*
on
the one
justifying
the
ungodly
is accounted
the
faith
of him
for
righteousness;
even as
also
David
speaks of
the
blessedness
of the
man
to whom
-
God
accounts
righteousness
apart from
works,
[they are] blessed
of whom
were forgiven
the
lawless deeds
and
of whom
were covered over
the
sins.
blessed
[is] a man
of whom
never
*
[the] Lord~would account
*
sin.
-
blessedness
therefore
[is] this
upon
the
circumcision
or
also
upon
the
uncircumcision?
for~we say,
*
was accounted
-
to Abraham
the (his)
faith
for
righteousness.
how
then
was it accounted?
in
circumcision
being
or
in
uncircumcison?
not
in
circumcision
but
in
uncircumcison
and
a sign
he received
of circumcision,
a seal
of the
righteousness
of the (his)
faith
-
[while] in
-
uncircumcision,
for
-
~to be
* him
a father
of all
the ones
believing
through
uncircumcision,
for
-
to be accounted
also
to them
the
righteousness,
and
a father
of circumcision
to the ones
not
of
circumcision
only
but
also
to the ones
keeping in step
with the
steps
of the
[while] in
uncircumcision
faith
of the
father
of us
Abraham.
~not
* for ~
through
law
[was] the
promise
-
to Abraham
or
to the
seed
of him,
that
heir
he
should be
of [the] world,
but
through
a righteousness
of faith.
if
for~
the
[are] of
law
heirs,
has been made void
-
faith
and
has been nullified
the
promise;
the
for~
law
wrath
works ~
where
but~
not
there is~
a law,
neither
[is there] transgression.
[it is] therefore
*
of
faith,
that
according to
grace [it may be],
for
-
to be
sure
the
promise
to all
the
seed,
not
to the [seed]
of
the
law
only
but
also
to the [seed]
of
[the] faith
of Abraham,
who
is
father
of us~all,
*
as
it has been written,
-
a father
of many
nations
I have appointed
you,
before
whom
he believed
God
the one
making alive
the
dead ones
and
calling
the things
not
being
as
being;
who
beyond
hope
on
hope
believed
that
-
he~should become
*
a father
of many
nations
according to
the thing
having been spoken,
so
will be
the
seed
of you,
and
not
having weakened
-
in faith
he considered
-
his own
body
already
having been dead,
one hundred years [old]
about
being,
and
the
deadness
of the
womb
of Sarah;
but~at
*
the
promise
-
of God
he did not waver
*
-
in unbelief,
but
was empowered
-
by faith,
giving
glory
-
to God
and
having been fully persuaded
that
what
he has promised
~able
he is ~
also 
to do.
wherefore
also
it was accounted
to him
for
righteousness.
not
it was written
now
because of
him
only
that
it was accounted
to him
but
also
because of
us,
to whom
it is about
to be accounted,
to the ones
believing
on
the one
having raised
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
from
the dead ones,
who
was given over [to death]
because of
the
trespasses
of us
and
was raised
because of
the
justification
of us.
having been justified
therefore
by
faith
peace
we have
toward
-
God
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
also
the
access
we have had
-
by faith
into
-
this~grace
*
in
which
we stand
and
boast
on
hope
of the
glory
-
of God.
not
only (so)
and,
but
also
we boast
in
-
tribulations,
knowing
that
-
tribulation
endurance
produces,
-
and
endurance
approvedness,
-
and
approvedness
hope.
-
and
hope
not
does put to shame,
because
the
love
-
of God
has been poured out
in
the
hearts
of us
through
spirit
[the] holy
-
having been given
to us.
-
for
Christ,
[when] were
we
weak,
still ~
in due time
*
on behalf of
ungodly ones
died.
for~scarcely
*
on behalf of
a righteous man
anyone
will die;
* ~ on behalf of
* for ~
the
good man
someone
someone
even
dares to
die;
demonstrates
but
-
his own
love
to
us
-
God,
that
still
sinners
being
we
Christ
on behalf of
us
died.
by much
then
rather
having been justified
now
in (by)
the
blood
of him
we will be saved
through
him
from
the
wrath.
if
for~
enemies
being
we were reconciled
-
to God
through
the
death
of the
son
of him,
by much
rather
having been reconciled
we will be saved
in (by)
the
life
of him.
not
only [so]
and,
but
also
boasting
in
-
God
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
now
the
reconciliation
we received.
therefore
*
as
through
one
man
-
sin
into
the
world
entered
and
through
-
sin
-
death,
so~also
*
to
all
men
-
death
came,
inasmuch as
*
all
sinned;
for~until
*
law
sin
was
in
[the] world,
but~sin
*
is not accounted
*
[where there] is not
*
a law,
but
reigned
-
death
from
Adam
until
Moses
even
over
the ones
not
having sinned
on (in)
the
likeness
of the
transgression
of Adam
who
is
a type
of the
one coming.
but
not
as
the
trespass,
so
also
the
gift;
if
for~
by the
of the
one man
trespass
the
many
died,
by much
rather
the
grace
-
of God
and
the
gift
in
grace
-
of the
one
man
Jesus
Christ
to
the
many
abounded.
and
not
as
through
one man
having sinned
[is] the
gift;
~ the
on one hand ~
for
judgment
[was] from
one [trespass]
[resulting] in
judgment,
~ the
on the other ~
gift
[follows] from
many
trespasses
[resulting] in
justification.
if
for~
by the
of the
one man
trespass
-
death
reigned
through
the
one man,
by much
rather
the ones
the
abundance
of the
grace
and
of the
gift
-
of righteousness
receiving
in
life
will reign
through
the
one man
Jesus
Christ.
so
then
as
through
one
trespass
for
all
men
[resulting] in
judgment,
so
also
through
one
righteous act
to
all
men
[resulting] in
justification
of (for) life.
for~as
*
through
the
disobedience
of the
one
man
sinners
were made
the
many,
so
also
through
the
obedience
of the
one man
righteous
will be made
the
many.
but~[the] law
*
entered
that
should increase
the
trespass;
but~where
*
increased
-
sin,
more increased
-
grace,
that
just as
reigned
-
sin
in
-
death,
so
also
-
grace
may reign
through
righteousness
[resulting] in
life
eternal
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us.
what
then
will we say?
should we continue
-
in sin,
that
-
grace
may increase?
never
may it be
who
we died
-
to sin,
how
still
will we live
in
it?
or
are you ignorant
that
as many as
were baptized
into
Christ
Jesus,
into
the
death
of him
were baptized?
thererfore~we were buried with
*
him
through
-
baptism
into
-
death,
that
just as
was raised
Christ
from
dead ones
through
the
glory
of the
father,
so
also
we
in
newness
of life
may walk.
for~if
*
we have~grown together
*
in the
likeness
of the
death
of him,
yet (so)
also
of the (his)
resurrection
we shall be;
this
knowing
that
-
old
our
humanity
was crucified with [him],
that
may be made ineffective
the
body
-
of sin,
[that]
no longer
[should] serve
we
-
sin;
for~the one
*
having died
has been justified
from
-
sin.
but~if
*
we died
with
Christ,
we believe
that
also
we will live with
him,
knowing
that
Christ
having been raised
from
dead ones
no more
dies,
death
him
no more
lords it over.
for~in that
*
he died,
-
to sin
he died
once;
but~in that
*
he lives,
he lives
-
to God.
so
also
you
account
yourselves
to be
dead ones
indeed
-
to sin
but~living
*
-
to God
in
Christ
Jesus.
not
therefore
let reign
-
sin
in
-
mortal
your
body
so as
-
to obey
the
lusts
of it,
neither
present
the
members
of you
[as] tools
of unrighteousness
-
to sin,
but
present
yourselves
-
to God
as
out from
dead ones
living
and
the
members
of you
tools
of righteousness
-
to God.
for~sin
*
you
not
will lord it over;
not
for
you are
under
law
but
under
grace.
what
then?
may we sin,
because
we are~not
*
under
law
but
under
grace?
never
may it be.
do you not know
*
that
to whom
you present
yourselves
slaves
for
obedience,
[his] slaves
you are
whom
you obey,
whether
of sin
[resulting] in
death
or
of obedience
[resulting] in
righteousness?
but~thanks [be]
*
-
to God
that
you used to be
slaves
-
of sin
but~you obeyed
*
from
[the] heart
to
which
you were committed
[the] pattern
of teaching,
and~having been freed
*
from
-
sin
you were enslaved
-
to righteousness.
humanly
I speak
because of
the
weakness
of the
flesh
of you
for~just as
*
you presented
the
members
of you
slaves
-
to impurity
and
-
to lawlessness
[resulting] in
-
lawlessness,
so
now
present
the
members
of you
slaves
-
to righteousness
[resulting] in
sanctification.
for~when
*
slaves
you were
-
of sin,
free ones
you were
-
to righteousness.
therefore~what
*
fruit
had you
then?
over
which things
now
you are ashamed,
for~the
*
result
of those things
[is] death.
now
but~
having been freed
from
-
sin
and~having been enslaved
*
-
to God
you have
the
fruit
of you
[resulting] in
sanctification,
the
and~
result
life
eternal.
for~the
*
wages
-
of sin
[is] death,
but~the
*
free gift
-
of God
[is] life
eternal
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us.
or
are you ignorant,
brothers,
for~to ones knowing
*
[the] law
I speak,
that
the
law
lords it over
the
person
over
such
time
[as] he lives?
for~the
*
woman~married
*
to the
living
husband
has been bound
by law;
but~if
*
dies
the
husband,
she has been released
from
the
law
of the
husband.
so
then
[while] lives
the
husband
an adulteress
she will be called
if
she becomes joined to
a different~husband;
*
but~if
*
dies
the
husband,
free
she is
from
the
law,
-
not
is
she
an adulteress
having been joined to
~husband.
a different
so that,
brothers
of me,
also
you
were put to death
to the
law
through
the
body
-
of Christ,
for
-
to be joined
you
to a different one,
to the one
from
dead ones
having been raised,
that
we may bear fruit
-
to God.
for~when
*
we were
in
the
flesh,
the
passions
-
of sins
-
through
the
law
were working
in
the
members
of us,
so as
-
to bear fruit
-
to death;
but~now
*
we were released
from
the
law
having died
[to that] in
which
we were being held,
so as
to serve
-
in
newness
of spirit
and
not
in oldness
of letter.
what
then
will we say?
[is] the
law
sin?
never
may it be.
but
-
sin
not 
I did know
except
*
through
law;
-
also
for~
lust
not
I was knowing
except
*
the
law
was saying,
not
you shall lust.
opportunity
but
having taken
-
sin
through
the
commandment
produced
in
me
every [kind of]
lust;
for~without
*
law
sin
[is] dead.
I
and ~
was living
without
law
once,
having come
but
the
commandment
-
sin
revived,
I
and~
died,
and
[it] was discovered
by me
[that] the
commandment
-
for
life
this
[was] for
death.
-
for
sin
opportunity
taking
through
the
commandment
deceived
me
and
through
it
killed [me].
so
the
-
law
[is] holy
and
the
commandment
holy
and
just
and
good.
then~the
*
good
to me
became
death?
never
may it be.
but
-
sin,
that
it may be shown [as]
sin,
through
the
good
to me
working
death,
that
might become
exceedingly
*
sinful
-
sin
through
the
commandment.
for~we know
*
that
the
law
spiritual
is,
but~I
*
am~carnal
*
having been sold
under
-
sin.
for~what
*
I work
I do not know;
*
for~not
*
what
I want
this
I do,
but
what
I hate
this
I do.
now~if
*
what
I do not want
*
this
I do,
I agree with
the
law
that
[it is] good.
but~now
*
no longer
I
work
it
but
the
dwelling
in
me
sin.
for~I know
*
that
not
dwells
in
me,
that
is
in
the
flesh
of me,
[anything] good;
-
for
to will
is present
with me,
-
but
to work
the
good
[is] not.
[I do] not [do]
for ~
the
I want
to do
good,
but
what
I do not want [to do]
*
~evil
this ~
I practise.
but~if
*
what
I do not want
*
I
this
do,
no longer
I
work
it
but
the
dwelling
in
me
sin.
I find
then
the
principle,
the one
wanting
to me
to do
the
good,
that
to me
the
evil
is present.
I delight
for~
in the
law
-
of God
with respected to
the
inner
man,
I see
but ~
a different
law
in
the
members
of me
warring against
the
law
of the
mind
of me
and
capturing
me
by
the
law
-
of sin
-
being
in
the
members
of me.
miserable
I am
man;
who
me
will rescue~
from
the
body
of
death?
this~
but~thanks
*
-
to God
through
Jesus
Christ
the
Lord
of us.
so
then
I~myself
*
with the
on one hand
mind
serve
[the] law
of God
with the
on the other
flesh
[the] law
of sin.
no
then
[there is] now
condemnation
to the ones
in
Christ
Jesus.
~the
for
law
of the
spirit
-
of life
in
Christ
Jesus
freed
you
from
the
law
-
of sin
and
-
of death.
~ what
for~
was impossible
[for] the
law [to do],
in
that
it was weak[ened]
by
the
flesh,
-
God [did]
-
his own
son
[by] having sent
in
[the] likeness
of flesh
of sin,
and
concerning
sin
he condemned
-
sin
in
the
flesh,
that
the
righteous requirements
of the
law
may be fulfilled
in
us
the ones
not
according to
flesh
walking
but
according to
spirit.
for~the ones
*
according to
flesh
being
the things
of the
flesh
think [about],
but~the ones
*
according to
spirit
the things
of the
spirit.
the
for~
mind
of (belonging to) the
flesh
[is] death,
the
but~
mind
of (belonging to) the
spirit
[is] life
and
peace.
because
the
mind
of (belonging to) the
flesh
[is] enmity
against
God,
to the
for~
law
-
of God
not
it is ~ subject,
neither
for~
can it be.
the ones
and~
in
[the] flesh
being
God
to please
not
are able.
but~you
*
~ not
are ~
in
[the] flesh
but
in
s(s)pirit,
since
[the] spirit
of God
dwells
in
you.
but~if
*
anyone
[the] spirit
of Christ
does not have,
*
this one
is~not
*
of him.
and~if
*
Christ
[is] in
you,
the
on one hand
body
[is] dead
because of
sin
the
on the other
spirit
[is] life
because of
righteousness.
and~if
*
the
spirit
of the one
having raised
-
Jesus
from
dead ones
dwells
in
you,
the one
having raised
Christ
from
dead ones
will make alive
also
the
mortal
bodies
of you
through
-
indwelling
his
spirit
in
you.
so
then,
brothers,
debtors
we are
not
to the
flesh
-
according to
flesh
to live.
for~if
*
according to
flesh
you live,
you are destined
to die;
but~if
*
by [the] spirit
the
practises
of the
body
you put to death,
you will live.
for~as many as
*
by [the] spirit
of God
are led,
these
sons
of God
are.
for~not
*
you received
a spirit
of slavery
again
to
fear
but
you received
a spirit
of sonship
in (by)
which
we cry,
Abba
-
Father.
itself
the
spirit
witnesses with
the
spirit
of us
that
we are
children
of God.
and~if
*
children,
also
heirs;
heirs
on one hand
of God,
co-heirs
on the other
of Christ,
if indeed
we suffer with [him]
that
also
we may be glorified with [him].
for~I reckon
*
that
[are] not
worthy
the
sufferings
of the
present
time
[to be compared] with
the
coming
glory
to be revealed
to (in)
us.
~the
for ~
anxious expectation
of the
creation
the
unveiling
of the
sons
-
of God
is eagerly expecting.
-
for
to vanity
the
creation
was subjected,
not
willing [ly],
but
because of
the one
having subjected [it].
in
hope
that
even
itself
the
creation
will be freed
from
the
slavery
-
of corruption
into
the
freedom
of the
glory
of the
children
-
of God.
for~we know
*
that
all
the
creation
groans together
and
travails in pain together
until
-
now;
not
only [so]
and,
but
also
ourselves
the
firstfruits
of the
spirit
having,
we
also
ourselves
in
ourselves
groan
eagerly expecting~sonship,
*
the
redemption
of the
body
of us.
with this
for~
hope
we were saved;
hope
but~
being seen
is~not
*
hope;
what
for~
sees
anyone
does he hope [for it]?
but~if
*
what
we do not see
*
we hope [for],
through
patience
we eagerly expect [it].
and~in like manner
*
also
the
spirit
joins in to help
the
weakness
of us;
-
for
what
we should pray
as
is necessary
we do not know,
*
but
itself
the
spirit
intercedes on [our] behalf
with groanings
unexpressed;
but~the one
*
searching
the
hearts
knows
what [is]
the
mind
of the
spirit,
because
according to
God
he intercedes
on behalf of
saints.
and~we know
*
that
to the ones
loving
-
God
all things
he works together
for
good,
to the ones
according to
[his] purpose
called
being.
because
whom
he foreknew,
also
he predestined [to be]
conformed to
the
image
of the
son
of him.
for
-
to be
him~
firstborn
among
many
brothers;
and~whom
*
he predestined,
these
also
he called;
and
whom
he called,
these
also
he justified;
and~whom
*
he justified,
these
also
he glorified.
what
then
will we say
to
these things?
if
-
God
[is] for
us,
who
against
us?
who
indeed
his own
*
son
~ not ~
did ~ spare
but
on behalf of
us
all
gave him up,
*
how
not
also
with
him
-
all things
to us
will he freely give?
who
will bring a charge
against
chosen ones
of God?
God
[is] the one
justifying.
who [is]
the one
condemning?
Christ
Jesus
[is] the one
having died,
but~rather
*
having been raised,
who
also
is
at
[the] right [hand]
-
of God,
who
also
intercedes
on behalf of
us.
who
will separate~us
*
from
the
love
-
of Christ?
tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
peril
or
sword?
as
it has been written,
-
for the sake
of you
we are being put to death
all
the
day,
we were considered
as
sheep
of (for) slaughter.
but
in
all~these things
*
we more than conquer
through
the one
having loved
us.
for~I have been persuaded
*
that
neither
death
nor
life
nor
angels
nor
rulers
nor
things present
nor
things coming
nor
powers
nor
height
nor
depth
nor
any
other~creature
*
will be able
us
to separate
from
the
love

of God
-
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us.

ages,
Amen.
not
however
*
that
has failed
the
word
-
of God.
not
for~
all
the ones
of
Israel
-
[are] Israel;
neither
because
they are
seed
of Abraham
[are they] all
children,
but,
in
Isaac
will be called
your
seed.
this (that)
is,
not
the
children
of the
flesh
-
[are] children
-
of God
but
the
children
of the
promise
are considered
for
a seed.
of promise
for
the
word
this [is],
according to
-
time
this~
I will come
and
there will be
-
to Sarah
a son.
not
only [so]
and,
but
also
Rebecca
of
one man
conceiving,
*
Isaac
the
father
of us;
not yet
for~
having been born
nor
practising
anything
good
or
bad,
that
the
according to
selection
purpose
-
of God
might remain.
not
of
works
but
of
the one
calling,
it was said
to her,
-
the
greater one
will serve
the
lesser one;
even as
it has been written,
-
Jacob
I loved,
-
but
Esau
I hated.
what
then
will we say?
[surely there is] not
unrighteousness
with
-
God?
never
may it be.
-
for ~ to Moses
*
he says,
I will have mercy on
whomever
*
I have mercy,
and
I will have compassion on
whomever
*
I have compassion.
so
then
[it is] not
of the one
desiring
nor
of the one
running
but
of the one
having mercy,
God.
for~says
*
the
scripture
-
to Pharaoh,
-
for
this very thing
*
I raised up
you,
so that
I may demonstrate
in
you
the
power
of me
and
so as
may be declared
the
name
of me
in
all
the
earth.
so
then
[on] whom
he wills
he has mercy,
and~whom
*
he wills
he hardens.
you say
to me
therefore,
why
then
still
he finds fault?
-
for
intention
his
who
has resisted?
o
man,
rather
you
who
are
the one
replying against
-
God?
[surely] not
will say
the thing
formed
to the one
having formed [it],
why
did you make~me
*
so?
or
has~not
*
[the] right
the
potter
of (over) the
clay
out of
the
same
lump
to make
this
*
for
honor [able use]
vessel
that
and~
for
dishonor [able use]?
[what] if
but~
wanting
-
God
to demonstrate
the (his)
wrath
and
to make known
the
power
of him
endured
with
much
longsuffering
vessels
of wrath
having been prepared
for
destruction,
so
that
he might make known
the
riches
of the
glory
of him
on
vessels
of mercy
which
he prepared beforehand
for
glory?
[among] whom
also
he called
us,
not
only
from
Jews
but
also
from
Gentiles,
as
also
in
-
Hosea
he says,
I will call
the
not
people
of me
a people
of me
and
the one
not
having been loved
having been loved (beloved).
and
it will be
in
the
place
where
it was said
to them,
not
a people
of me
you are,
there
they will be called
sons
of a living~God.
*
and ~ Isaiah
*
cries
on behalf of
-
Israel,
if
be
the
number
of the
sons
of Israel
as
the
sand
of the
sea,
the
remnant
will be saved;
[the] word
for
finishing [it]
and
cutting [it] short
will execute
[the] Lord
on
the
earth.
and
as
has said before,
Isaiah ~
except,
*
[the] Lord
of Sabaoth (hosts)
left
to us
a seed,
as
Sodom
would
we have become
and
as
Gomorrah
would
we have been made like.
what
then
will we say?
that
Gentiles
-
not
pursuing
righteousness
attained
righteousness,
and~a righteousness
*
-
by
faith?
but ~ Israel
*
pursuing
a law
of righteousness
to (at)
[that] law
did not arrive.
*
why?
*
because
[it was] not
by
faith
but
as
by
works;
they stumbled
at the
stone
-
of stumbling,
as
it has been written,
behold
I place
in
Zion
a stone
of stumbling
and
a rock
of offense,
and
the one
believing
on
him
will not be put to shame.
*
brothers,
the
-
good pleasure
-
of my
heart
and
the
supplication
to
-
God
on behalf of
them
[is] for
salvation.
for~I bear witness
*
to them
that
a zeal
of (for) God
they have,
but
not
according to
knowledge;
being ignorant of
for~
the
-
righteousness~of God
*
and
the [ir]
own
righteousness
seeking
to establish,
to the
righteousness
-
of God
they did not submit;
*
end
for
of law
Christ [is]
[resulting] in
righteousness
to everyone
*
believing.
for ~ Moses
*
writes [of]
the
righteousness
-
of
the
law
that
the
having done
these things
man
will live
in(by)
them.
but~
the
of
faith
righteousness
thus
speaks,
do not say
*
in
the
heart
of you,
who
will ascend
into
-
heaven?
this (that)
is
Christ
to bring down;
or,
who
will descend
into
the
abyss?
this (that)
is
Christ
from
dead ones
to bring up.
but
what
does [it] say?
near
you
the
word
is
in
the
mouth
of you
and
in
the
heart
of you,
this (that)
is
the
word
-
of faith
which
we preach.
because
if
you confess
with
the
mouth
of you
Lord
Jesus
and
you believe
in
the
heart
of you
that
-
God
raised~him
*
from
dead ones,
you will be saved.
with[the] heart
for~
one believes
[resulting] in
righteousness,
with[the] mouth
and~
one confesses
[resulting] in
salvation.
for~says
*
the
scripture,
everyone
*
believing
on
him
will not be put to shame.
*
no
for
[there] is
difference
Jew
between
and
Greek,
for~the
*
same
Lord
of all
[is] being rich
to
all
the ones
calling on
him;
for~everyone
*
whoever
*
calls on
the
Lord's~name
*
will be saved.
how
then
may they call on [one]
in
whom
~ not ~
they did ~ believe?
and~how
*
may they believe [him]
of whom
they did not hear?
*
and~how
*
may they hear
without
one preaching?
and~how
*
may they preach
if
they are not sent?
*
as
it has been written,
how
beautiful
the
feet
of the ones
proclaiming good news
-
[of] good things.
but
not
all
obeyed
the
good news.
for ~ Isaiah
*
says,
Lord,
who
believed
the
report
of us?
then
-
faith
[comes] from
hearing
-
and
hearing
through
[the] word
of Christ.
but
I say,
no
not
did they hear?
indeed [they did],
into
all
the
earth
went out
the
voice
of them
and
to
the
ends
of the
inhabited world
the
words
of them.
but
I say,
-
[did] Israel
not
know?
first
Moses
says,
I
will provoke to jealousy
you
by
[one] not
a nation,
by
a nation,
without understanding
I will anger
you.
but ~ Isaiah
*
is very bold
and
says,
I was found
by
the ones
me
not
seeking,
I became~manifest
*
to the ones
me
not
asking for.
but~to
*
-
Israel
he says,
all
the
day
I reached out
the
hands
of me
toward
a people
disobeying
and
opposing.
I say
then,
[surely did] not
put away
-
God
the
people
of him?
never
may it be;
for~also
*
I
An Israelite
am,
from
[the] seed
of Abraham,
of [the] tribe
of Benjamin.
did not put away
*
-
God
the
people
of him
whom
he foreknew.
or
do you not know
*
in (about)
Elijah
what
says
the
scripture,
how
he pleads with
-
God
against
-
Israel?
Lord,
the
prophets
of you
they killed ,
the
altars
of (for) you
they dug down,
and  I
was left behind
alone
and
they seek
the
life
of me.
but
what
says
to him
the
divine answer?
I reserved
for myself
seven thousand
men,
who
did not bow
*
a knee
-
to Baal.
so
then
also
in
the
present
time
a remnant
according to
a selection
of grace
has come into being.
if
but~
by grace
no more
of
works,
since
-
grace
no more
becomes
grace.
what
then?
what
Israel~ is seeking
*
this
it did not obtain
*
but~the
*
elect
obtained [it]
the
and~
rest
were hardened,
as
it has been written,
gave
to them
-
God
a spirit
of deep sleep,
eyes
-
not
to see
and
ears
-
not
to hear,
until
very
this 
day.
and
David
says,
let become
the
table
of them
for
a snare
and
for
a net
and
for
a trap
and
for
a retribution
to them,
let be darkened
the
eyes
of them
-
not
to see
and
the
back
of them
continually
*
let bend.
I say
then,
[surely] they did not stumble
*
that
they might fall?
never
may it be.
but
by
their
trespass
the
salvation
[came] to the
Gentiles,
so as to
*
provoke to jealousy
them.
now~if
*
the
trespass
of them
[means] riches
of (for) [the] world
and
the
failure
of them
[means] riches
of (for) [the] Gentiles,
by how much
more
the
fullness
of them.
now~to you
*
I speak,
the
Gentiles;
in as much as
*
-
therefore
am
I
of [the] Gentiles
an apostle,
the
ministry
of me
I glorify,
if
somehow
I may provoke to jealousy
[those of] my
-
flesh
and
may save
some
of
them.
if
for~
the
casting away
of them
[brings the] reconciliation
of [the] world,
what [will mean]
the[ir]
acceptance
if
not
life
from
dead ones?
now~if
*
the
first fruit
[is] holy,
also
the
lump;
and
if
the
root
[is] holy,
also
the
branches.
but~if
*
some
of the
branches
were broken off,
and~you
*
being~a wild olive tree
*
were grafted in
among
them
and
a partaker
of the
root
of the
fatness
of the
olive tree
became,
not 
do boast
of the
branches,
but~ if
*
you boast,
not
you
the
root
bear
but
the
root
you.
you will say
then,
were broken off
branches
that
I
might be grafted in.
[you say] well;
-
for unbelief
they were broken off,
but~you
*
-
by faith
have stood.
not
high things
mind
but
fear;
if
for~
-
God
the
according to
nature
branches
not 
did spare,
perhaps
*
neither
you
will he spare.
see
then
[the] kindness
and
severity
of God;
on
-
the ones
having fallen
severity,
but~on
*
you
[the] kindness
of God,
if
you continue
in the (his)
kindness,
since[otherwise]
also
you
will be cut off.
~those ones~
and ~ also,
if
~  not ~
they do ~ continue
-
in unbelief,
will be grafted in;
able
for
is
-
God
again
to engraft
them.
if
for~
you
from
the
according to
nature
were cut
wild olive tree
and
against
nature
were engrafted
into
a cultivated olive tree,
by how much
more
these ones
-
according to
nature
will be grafted into
the[ir]
own
olive tree
~ not ~
for ~
I do ~ want
you
to be ignorant
brothers,
-
[of] this~mystery,
*
lest
*
you be
in
yourselves
wise,
that
hardness
in part
*
-
to Israel
has happened
until
*
the
fullness
of the
Gentiles
comes in,
and
so
all
Israel
will be saved;
as
it has been written,
will come
out of
Zion
the one
delivering,
he will turn away
ungodliness
from
Jacob.
and
this
to them
[is] the
from
me
covenant,
when
I take away
the
sins
of them.
according to
-
the
good news
[they are] enemies
because of
you,
according to
but ~
the
election
[they are] beloved
because of
the
fathers;
for~[are] irrevocable
*
the
free gifts
and
the
calling
-
of God
for~just  as
*
you
once
disobeyed
-
God
but~now
*
you received mercy
by the
of these ones

so
also
these ones
now 
were disobedient
-
to [what was] for you
mercy,
that
also
they
now
may receive mercy.
consigned
for
-
God
-
all
in
disobedience,
that
-
to all
he may show mercy.
o
[the] depth
of [the] riches
and
of [the] wisdom
and
knowledge
of God;
how
unsearchable
the
judgments
of him
and
untraceable
the
ways
of him.
for~who
*
knew
[the] mind
of [the] Lord?
or
who
a counsellor
of him
became?
or
who
previously gave
to him.
and
it will be repaid
to him?
because
from
him
and
through
him
and
to
him
-
[are] all things;
to him
[be] the
glory
into
the
ages,
amen.
therefore~I urge
*
you,
brothers,
through
the
compassions
-
of God
to present
the
bodies
of you
a sacrifice
living,
holy,
well-pleasing
-
to God,
[which is] the
spiritual
service
of you;
and
not
do be conformed
-
to this~age,
*
but
be transformed
by the
renewing
of the (your)
mind
for
-
you~to prove
*
what
[is] the
will

of God,

good
and

judgment seat
-
of God,
for~it hs been written,
*
live
I,
says
[the] Lord,
that
to me
will bend
every
knee
and
every
tongue
will confess
-
to God.
so
then
each one
of us
concerning
himself
account
will give
-
to God.
no longer
therefore
one another
let us judge;
but
this
judge
rather,
-
not
to put
a stumbling  block
to ones
brother
or
a trap.
I know
and
have been persuaded
in
[the] Lord
Jesus
that
nothing
[is] common
through (in)
itself,
except
*
to the one
counting
anything
common
to be,
to that man
[it is] common.
if
for~
because of
food
the
brother
of you
is grieved,
no longer
according to
love
you walk;
not
by the
food
of you
that man
ruin
on behalf
of whom
Christ
died.
not
let be spoken against
therefore
your
-
good.
for~not
*
is
the
kingdom
-
of God
eating
and
drinking
but
righteousness
and
peace
and
joy
in
[the] spirit
holy;
for~the one
*
in
this
serving
-
Christ
[is] well-pleasing
-
to God
and
approved
-
by men.
so
then
the things
-
of peace
let us pursue
and
the things
-
of building up
-
for
one another.
not
for the sake of
food
destroy
the
work
-
of God
all things
indeed
[are] clean,
but
evil
to the
man [who]
-
by
[causes] stumbling
eating.
[it is] good
-
not
to eat
flesh
nor
to drink
wine
nor [anything]
by
which
the
brother
of you
stumbles.
you
[the] faith
which
have
by
yourself
have
before
-
God.
blessed
the one
not
judging
himself
in (for)
what
he approves;
but~the one
*
being doubtful
if
he eats
has been condemned
because
[it is] not
out of
faith;
and~all
*
which
[is] not
out of
faith
is~sin.
*
ought
now
we
the
strong
the
weaknesses
of the ones
not strong
to bear,
and
not
ourselves
to please.
each one
of us
the (his)
neighbor
let him please
for
-
good
with a view to
building up.
for~even
*
-
Christ
not
himself
pleased;
but
as
it has been written,
the
reproaches
of the ones
reproaching
you
fell
on
me.
whatever things
for~
were written before,
for
-
our
teaching
were written,
that
through
-
endurance
and
through
the
encouragement
of the
scriptures
-
hope
we may have.
now~the
*
God
-
of endurance
and
-
encouragement
give
to you
the same thing
*
to think
among
one another
according to
Christ
Jesus,
that
with one accord [and]
with
one
mouth
you may glorify
the
God
and
father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ.
wherefore
receive
one another,
as
also
-
Christ
received
you
to
[the] glory
-
of God.
I say
for ~
Christ
to have become~a servant
*
of [the] circumcision
on behalf of
[the] truth [fulness]
of God,
so as to
-
confirm
the
promises
of (to) the
fathers,
and
the
Gentiles
for
[his] mercy
to glorify
-
God,
as
it has been written.
therefore
*
I will give praise
to you
among
Gentiles
and
to the
name
of you
I will sing praise
and
again
he says,
rejoice,
Gentiles,
with
the
people
of him.
and
again,
praise,
all
the
Gentiles,
the
Lord,
and
let praise
him
all
the
peoples.
and
again
Isaiah
says,
there will be
the
root
-
of Jesse
even
the one
rising up
to rule
Gentiles,
on
him
Gentiles
will hope.
~ the
now [many]
God
-
of hope
fill
you
with all
joy
and
peace
in
-
believing,
for
-
you~to abound
*
in
-
hope
by
[the] power
of [the] spirit
holy.
and~I have been persuaded,
*
brothers
of me,
even
[my]self
I~
concerning
you
that
also
yourselves
full
are~
of goodness,
having been filled
with all
-
knowledge,
being able
also
one another
to admonish.
but~boldly
*
I wrote
to you
in part
*
as
reminding
you
on account of
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
from
-
God
for
-
me~to be
*
a servant
of Christ
Jesus
to
the
Gentiles,
administering in sacred service
the
good news
-
of God,
that
may be
the
offering
of the
Gentiles
acceptable,
having been sanctified
by
[the] spirit
holy.
I have
therefore
the (my)
boasting
in
Christ
Jesus
[as to] the things
pertaining to
-
God;
for~not
*
I will dare
anything
to speak
of the things which
did not work out
*
Christ
through
me
for
obedience
of Gentiles,
in word
and
work,
by
power
of signs
and
wonders,
by
power
of [the] spirit
of God;
so as for
me
from
Jerusalem
and
around
unto
-
Illyricum,
I have fully proclaimed
the
good news
-
of Christ,
so
and ~
aspiring
to preach the good news
not
where
was named,
Christ
that
not
on
another's
foundation
I might build.
but
as
it has been written,
[the ones] to whom
not
it was announced
concerning
him
will see,
and
the ones [who]
not

also
I was being hindered
greatly

-
to come
to
you;

in

to come

you
for

I take a journey

you

you

this

he may become

the
for
wisdom
-
world
of this
foolishness
with
-
God
is
it has been written
for
he
is catching
the
wise
in
the
craftiness
of them
and
again,
(the) Lord
knows
the
reasonings
of the
wise
that
they are
vain
so
no one
let boast
in
men
all things
for
of you
are
whether
Paul
or
Apollos
or
Cephas,
or
(the) world
or
life
or
death,
or
things present
or
things coming
all things
(are) of you
you
and
(are) of Christ
Christ
and
(is) of God
so
us
let account
a man
as
attendants
of Christ
and
stewards
of (the) mysteries
of God
furthermore
*
it is sought
in
the
stewards
that
faithful
one
be found
me
but
to
a very small thing
it is
that
by
you
I am judged
or
by
a human
day (of judgment)
but
not
myself
I judge.
(of) nothing
for
against myself
I am conscious
but
not
by
this
have I been justified,
the one
but
judging
me
Lord
is
so as
not
before
(the) time
anything
judge
until
*
comes
the
Lord
who
both
will bring to light
the
hidden things
of the
darkness
and
manifest
the
motives
of the
hearts
and
then
the
praise
will be
to each one
from
-
God
these things
now
brothers
I made into a figure (of speech)
with respect to
myself
and
Apollos
for
you
that
by (through)
us
you may learn
-
not
(to go) beyond
what things
have been written
that
not
one
for
the
one
you are puffed up
against
the
other
who
for
you
distinguishes
what
and
do you have
which
not
you received
if
and
indeed
you received (it)
why
do you boast
as
not
having received (it)
already
you have been satiated
*(you have been)
already
you became rich,
without
us
you became kings
and
I would (that)
really
you became kings
that
also
we
you
might become kings with
I think
for
-
God
us
the
apostles
last
showed forth
as
condemned to death
because
a spectacle
we became
to the
world
both
to angels
and
to men
we (are)
fools
because of
Christ
you
but
wise
in
Christ
we (are)
weak
you
but
strong
you (are)
honorable
we
but
dishonorable
until
the
present
hour
both
we hunger
and
thirst
and
are naked
and
are beaten
and
are unsettled
and
we labor
working (with)
the (our)
own
hands
being reviled
we bless
being persecuted
we dear (it)
being defamed
we implore
as
offscourings
of the
world
we became
of all things
(the) refuse
until
now
not
shaming
you
I write
these things
but
as
children
of me
beloved
admonishing
though
for
ten thousand
guides
you have
in
Christ
but
not
many
fathers
in
for
Christ
Jesus
through
the
gospel
I
you
begot
I encourage
therefore
you
imitators
of me
become
because of
this
I sent
to you
Tomothy
who
is
my
child
beloved
and
trustworthy
in
(the) Lord
who
you
will remind
of the
ways
of me
-
in
Christ
Jesus
even as
everywhere
in
every
church
I teach
as to
not
coming
now
my
to
you
were puffed up
some
I will come
but
shortly
to
you
if
the
Lord
wills
and
I will find out
not
the
speech
of the ones
having been puffed up
but
the
power
not
for
in
speech
(is) the
kingdom
-
of God
but
in
power
what
do you want
with
a rod
should I come
to
you
or
in
love
a spirit
and
of meekness
actually
is reported
among
you
fornication
and
such
fornication
which (is)
not even
among
the
gentiles
so that
wife
one
of the
father
to have
and
you
have been puffed up
are
and
not
rather
grieved
that
should be taken
from
(the) midst
of you
the one
-
deed
this
having done
I
indeed
for
being absent
in the (my)
body
being present
but
in the (my)
spirit
already
have I judged
as
being present
the one
so
this thing
having done
in
the
name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
having been gathered together
you
and
the
of me
spirit
with
the
power
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
to hand over
-
such a one
-
to Satan
for
destruction
of the
flesh
that
the (his)
spirit
may be saved
in
the
day
of the
Lord
not
good
(is) the
boast
of you.
not
you know
that
a little
leaven
all
the
lump
leavens
purge out
the
old
leaven
that
you may be
a new
lump
as
you are (really)
unleavened
indeed
for
the
passover (lamb)
of us
was sacrificed
Christ
so
let us keep the feast
not
with
leaven
old
nor
with
leaven
of malice
and
of evil
but
with
unleavened (bread)
of purity
and
of truth
I wrote
to you
in
the
epistle
not
to mix with
fornicators
not (meaning)
complete (dissociation from)
the
fornicators
of the
world
of this
or
the
greedy
and
swindlers
or
idolaters
since
you would have
then
from
the
world
to go out
now
but
I wrote
to you
not
to mix with
if
any
brother
he is being called
*(be)
a fornicator
or
a greedy man
or
an idolater
or
a reviler
or
a drunkard
or
a swindler
with
such a one
not

what
for
(is it) to me
the ones
outside

not
the ones
within

the (ones)
but
outside
-
God
will judge
remove
the
evil one
from (among)
yourselves
*
dares
anyone
of you
a dispute
having
with
the
other
to be judged
before
the
unrighteous
and
not
before
the
saint
or
do not
you know
that
the
saints
the
world
will judge
and
if
by
you
is judged
the
world
incompetent
are you
judges
(of the) smallest matters
do not
you know
that
angels
we will judge
not
to speak
of this life
of this life
truly
then
a case
if
you have
the ones
being least esteemed
by
the
church
such ones
(how) could you appoint (as judges)
for
shame
to you
I speak
thus
not
there is
among
you
not even one
wise
who
will be able
to make judgement
between
*
the
brohter(s)
of him
but
brohter
with
brohter
is judged
and
this
before
unbelievers
already
truly
therefore
altogether
a defeat
for you
it is
that
lawsuits
you have
with
one another
why
*
not
rahter
be wronged
why
*
not
rather
be cheated
but
you
do wrong
and
cheat
and
this
(to your) brothers

not

(the) unrighteous ones

nothing

nothing

let him remain

were you called
not

if
indeed
you are able

make use (of it)

for
in

a freedman
of (the) Lord

(while) a freedman

each one
in

he was called
brothers
in

let him remain
with
God
concerning
now
the
virgins
a commandment
of (the) Lord

I have
an opinion

I give
as
(having been shown)  mercy

not
she sinned

but
in the

such ones
I
but
you
am trying to spare
this
but
I say
brothers
the
time
has been shortened
*
from now on

that
both
the ones
having
wives
as
not
having
may be

the ones
weeping
as
not
weeping
and
the ones
rejoicing
as
not

and
the ones
buying
as
not

the ones
using
the

as
not
fully using (it)

for
the
present form

world
of this
I desire
but
you
free from care
to be
the
unmarried man
cares for
the things
of the
Lord
how
he may please
the
Lord
the one
but
having married
cares for
the things
of the
world
how
he may please
the (his)
wife
and
he has been distracted
both
the
woman
-
unmarried
and
the
virgin
cares for
the things
of the
Lord
that
she may be
holy
both
in the
body
and
in the
spirit
the woman

having married
cares for
the things
of the
world
how
she may please
the (her)
husband
this
now
for
the
of yourselves

profit
I speak
not
that
a noose
you
I may put on
but (I speak)
with respect to
what (is)
proper
and
constant service
to the
Lord
in an undistracted way
if
but
anyone
to behave improperly
toward
the
virgin
of him
thinks
if
she is
past her prime
and
thus
it has to be
it has to be
what
he desires
let him do
not
he sins
let them marry
he who
but
has stood
in
the
heart
of him
firm
not
having
(the) need
mastery

has
concerning
his 
own
desire
and
this
he has decided
in
his 
own
heart
to keep (her)
his own woman

a virgin
well
he does
so then
both
the one
marrying
his own
*
virgin
well
does
and
the one
not
marrying
better
does
a wife
has been bound
for
so long
a time as
lives
the
husband
of her
if
but
should sleep
the (her)
husband
free
she is
to whom
she desires
to be married
only
in
(the) Lord.  /  [the] Lord
more blessed
but
she is
if
so
she remains
according to
-
my
opinion
I consider (myself)
and
I also
(the) spirit
of God
to have
concerning
now
the
idolatrous sacrifices
we know
that
all
knowledge
we have
-
knowledge
puffs up
-
but
love
builds up
if
anyone
thinks
to have known
anything
not yet
he knew
as
it is necessary
to know
if
but
anyone
loves
-
God
this one
has been known
by
him
concerning
the
eating
therefore
of the
idolatrous sacrifices
we know
that
(is) nothing
an idol
in
(the) world
and
that
(there is) no
God
except
*
one
even
for
if
there are
ones being called
Gods
either
in
heaven
or
on
earth
even as
there are
Gods
many
and
Lords
many
yet
to us
(there is) one
God
the
father
of
whom
-
(are) all things
and
we
in
him
and
one
Lord
Jesus
Christ
through
whom
-
(are) all things
and
we
in
him
but
(there is) not
in
all men
the (this)
knowledge;
some
but
-
(being) accustomed
until
now
to the
idol
as
an idolatrous sacrifice
eat (food)
and
the
conscience
of them
weak
being
is defiled
food
but
us
not
will commend
-
to God
neither
if
not
we eat
are we lacking
nor
if
we eat
are we better
beware
but
lest
somehow
-
right
of you
this
a stumbling block
becomes
to the ones
weak
if
for
anyone
sees
you
the one
having
knowledge
in
an idol's temple
reclinning (eating)
not
the
conscience
of him
weak
being
will be bolstered
so
as
the
idolatrous sacrifices
to eat
is being destroyed
for
the one
being weak
by
-
your
knowledge
the
brother
for the sake of
whom
Christ
died
thus
and
sinning
against
the
brothers
and
wounding
of them
the
conscience
being weak
against
Christ
you sin
therefore
if
food
causes to stumble
the
brother
of me
never
never
should I eat
meat
into

I may gain

without law
I became

that
the

I might gain

to all men
I have become
all things

by all means
some
I might save
all things
and
I do
because of
the
gospel
that
a fellow-partaker
of it
I may become

in

running

indeed
run

so
run
that
you may obtain (it)
everyone
and

competing (in the games)
(in) all things
exercises self-control
those ones
-
therefore
that
a perishable
wreath
they may receive
we
but
an imperishable
I
therefore
so
run
as
not
uncertainly
so
I box
as
not
(the) air
beating
but
I treat roughly
of me
the
body
and
make it (my) slave
lest
*
to others
having preached
myself
disqualified
I may become.  /  I my become
not
I want
and
you
to be ignorant
brothers
that
the
fathers
of us
all
under
the
cloud
were
and
all
through
the
sea
passed
and
all
into
-
Moses
were baptized
in
the
cloud
and
in
the
sea
and
all
the
same
spiritual
food
ate
and
all
the
same
spiritual
drank
drink
they were drinking
for
from
a spiritual
following (them)
rock
the
rock
and
was
-
Christ
but
not
with
the
majority
of them
was pleased
-
God
they were strewn about
for
in
the
wilderness
these things
now
(as) examples
of (for) us
occurred
for
-
not
to be
us
ones desiring after
evil things
as
also those ones
desired
neither
idolaters
should you become
as
some
of them
as
it has been written
sat down
the
people
to eat
and
to drink
and
stood up
to play
neither
let us commit fornication
as
some
of them
committed fornication
and
fell
in one
day
twenty-
three
thousand
neither
let us tempt
-
Christ
as
some
of them
tempted
and
by
the
serpents
were being destroyed
neither
murmur
even as
some
of them
murmured
and
they were destroyed
by
the
destroyer
these things
now
as examples
happened
to those ones
it was written
but
for
admonition
of us
to
whom
the
ends
of the
ages
have come
so then
the one
assuming
to have stood
take heed
lest
he should fall
a temptation
you
not
has taken
except
*
(that which is) human
faithful
but
-
(is) God
who
not
will let
you
to be tempted
beyond
what
you are able
but
will make
with
the
temptation
also
the
way out
-
(for you) to be able
to endure
therefore
beloved
of me
flee
from
-
idolatry
as
to thoughtful men
I speak
judge
you
what
I say
the
cup
-
of blessing
which
we bless
not
a sharing
is it
of the
blood
-
of Christ
the
bread
which
we break
not
a sharing
of the
body
-
of Christ
is it
because
one
bread
one
body
(we) the
many
are
-
for
all
of
the
one
bread
we partake
look at
-
Isreal
according to
(the) flesh
not
the ones
eating
the
sacrifices
partakers
of the
altar
are
what
then
am I saying
that
an idolatrous sacrifice
anything
is
or
that
an idol
anything
is
but
that
the things which
they sacrifice
to demons
and
not
to God
they sacrifice
not
I want
-
you
sharers
of the
demons
to become
not
you are ble
(the) cup
of (the) Lord
to drink
and
(the) cup
of demons
not
you are able
a table
of (the) Lord
to partake
and
a table
of demons
or
do we make jealous
the
Lord
not
stronger
than he
are we
all things
(are) lawful
but
not
all things
(are) beneficial
all things
(are) lawful
but
not
all things
edify
no one
the things
of himself
let seek
but
the thing
of the
other
everything
everything
in
a meat market
being sold
eat
without raising questions
*
because of
-
conscience
of the
Lord
for
(is) the
earth
and
the
fullness
of it
if
anyone
invites
you
of the
unbelievers
and
you want
to go
everything
-
being set before
you
eat
without raising questions
*
because of
-
conscience
if
but
anyone
to you
should says
this
offered in sacrifice
is
not
eat
because of
that man
-
having revealed (it)
and
-
(becaues of) conscience
conscience
but
I say
not
the
of himself
but
the (conscience)
of the
other man
why
for
the
freedom
of me
is judged
by
another's
conscience
if
I
with thanksgiving
partake
why
am I blamed
for
what
I
give thanks (for)
whether
therefore
you eat
or
you drink
or
what(ever)
you do
all things
to
(the) glory
of God
do
without offense
both
to Jews
be
and
to Greeks
and
to the
church
-
of God
even as
I also
(in) all things
all men
please
not
seeking
the
of myself
advantage
but
that
of the
many
that
they may be saved
imitators
of me
become
as
I also (am)
of Christ.
I praise
now
you
that
(in) all things
me
you have remembered
and
just as
I handed (them) over
to you
the
traditions
you hold fast
I want
but
you
to know
that
of every
man
the
head
-
Christ
is
(the) head
and
of a woman
(is) the
man
(the) head
and
-
of Christ
-
(is) God
every
man
praying
or
prophesying
down over
(his) head
having (anything)
shames
the
head
of him.
every
but
woman
praying
or
prophesying
uncovered
with the (her)
head
shames
the
head
of her
one
for
it is
and
the
same
-
with having been shaved
if
for
not
is covered
a woman
also
let her be shorn
since
but
(it is) shameful
for a woman
-
to be shorn
or
to be shaved
let her be covered
a man
indeed
for
not
ought
to be covered on
the
head
(the) image
and
glory
of God
being
the
woman
but
(the) glory
of a man
is
not
for
is
man
of
woman
but
woman
of
man
also
for
not
was created
man
because of
the
woman
but
woman
because of
the
man
because of
this
ought
the
woman
authority
to have
on
the
head
because of
the
angels
however
neither
(is) woman
without
man
nor
man
without
woman
in
(the) Lord
just as
for
the
woman
(is) of
the
man
so
also
(is) the
man
through
the
woman
-
but
all things
(are) of
-
God
among
yourselves
*
judge
fitting
is it
(for) a woman
uncovered
-
to God
to pray
not
-
nature
herself
teach
you
that
a man
-
if
he wears long hair
a dishonor
to him
it is
a woman
but
if
she wears long hair
a glory
to her
it is
because
the
long hair
instead of
a covering
has been given
to her
if
but
anyone
thinks
contentious
to be
we
such
a custom
not
do have
neither
the
churches
-
of God
this (that follows)
but
in giving charge
not
I give  praise
because
not
for
the
better
but
for
the
worse
you come together
first
indeed
for
when come together
you
in
an assembly
I hear
divisions
among
you
to exist
and
partly
*
I believe (it)
it is necessary
for
also
(for) sects
among
you
to be
that
also
the
approved ones
manifest
may become
among
you
coming together
therefore
your
into
one
place
not
it is
of (the) Lord
a supper
(you) eat
each one
for
his
*
supper
takes first
in
-
eating
and
one
-
hungers
one
and
is drunk
not
for
houses
not
you have
in which
*
to eat
and
to drink
or
the
church
-
of God
do you despise
and
do you shame
the ones
not
having
what
should I say
to you
will I praise
you
in
this
not
I praise (you)
I
for
received
from
the
Lord
that which
also
I passed on
to you
that
the
Lord
Jesus
in
the
night
in which
he was being betrayed
took
bread
and
having given thanks
he broke (it)
and
said
this
of me
is
the
body
-
on behalf
of you
this
do
in
-
my
remembrance
in like manner
also
the
cup
after
the
eating of supper
saying
this
-
cup
the
new
covenant
is
in
-
my
blood
this
do
as often
as
you drink
in
-
my
remembrance
as often
for
as
you eat
-
bread
this
and
the
cup
drink
the
death
of the
Lord
you proclaim
until
*
he comes
so
whoever
*
eats
the
bread
or
drinks
the
cup
of the
Lord
unworthily
guilty
will be
of the
body
and
of the
blood
-
of (the) Lord
let examine
but
a man
himself
and
so
of
the
bread
let him eat
and
of
the
cup
let him drink
the one
for
eating
and
drinking
judgment
to himself
eats
and
drinks
(when) not
discerning
the
body
because of
this
among
you
many
(are) weak
and
sick
and
are a sleep
a number
if
for
ourselves
we were judging
not
*
we would  be judged
being judged
but
by
the
Lord
we are being disciplined
that
not
with
the
world
would we be condemned
so then
brothers
of me
(when) coming together
-
-
to eat
one another
wait for
if
anyone
hungers
in
(his) home
let him eat
lest
*
for
judgment
you come together
the
and
remaining matters
whenever
*
I come
I will set in order
concerning
now
-
spiritual things
brothers
not
I want
you
to be ignorant
you know
that
when
gentiles
you were
to
the
idols
-
mute
whenever
*
you were being led
(you were) being carried away
wherefore
I make known
to you
that
no one
by
(the) spirit
of God
speaking
says
a curse
(is) Jesus
and
no one
is able
to say
Lord
Jesus
except
*
by
(the) spirit
holy
different (kinds)
-
of gifts
there are
the
but
same
spirit
and
different (kinds)
of ministries
there are
and
the
same
Lord
and
different (kinds)
of operations
there are
the
and
same
God
-
working
-
all things
in
all
to each
but
is given
the
manifestation
of the
spirit
for
-
profit
to one
-
for
through
the
spirit
is given
a word
of wisdom
to another
and
a word
of knowledge
according to
the
same
spirit
to another
faith
by
the
same
spirit
to another
and
gifts
of healings
by
the
one
spirit
to another
and
(the) workings
of (miraculous) powers
to another
and
prophecy
to another
and
discernings
of spirits
to another
kinds
of tongues
to another
and
interpretation
of tongues
all
-
these things

whether

God

that
you may prophesy

not

to God;
no one
for
hears
in spirit
but
he speaks
mysteries;
the one
but
prophesying
to men
speaks
(for) edification
and
encouragement
and
consolation
the one
speaking
in a tongue
himself
edifies
the one
but
prophesying
an assembly
edifies
I desire
and
all
of you
to speak
in tongues
rather
but
that
you may prophesy
greater
and
(is) the one
prophesying
than
the one
speaking
in tongues
unless
*
*
he interprets
that
the
church
edification
may receive
now
but
brothers
if
I come
to
you
in tongues
speaking
what
you
will I benefit ~ you
except
*
to you
I speak
either
with
a revelation
or
with
knowledge
or
with
a prophecy
or
with
a teaching
even
-
lifeless things
a sound
giving
whether
flute
or
harp
if
a distinction
in the
notes
not
they give
how
will it be known
what
is being played (on the flute)
or
what
is being harped
indeed
for
if
an unclear
a trumpet
call
gives
who
will prepare himself
for
battle
so
also
you
by
the (your)
tongue
unless
*
an intelligible
message
give
how
will it be known
the thing
being said
you will be
for
into
(the) air
speaking
so many
it may be
*
kinds
of languages
there are
in
(the) world
and
not one
(is) meaningless
if
therefore
not
I know
the
meaning
of the
voice
I will be
to the one
speaking
a foreigner
and
the one
speaking
with
me
a foreigner
so
also
you
since
zealots
you are
of spiritual things
for
the
edification
of the
church
be zealous
that
you may abound
therefore
the one
speaking
in a tongue
let him pray
that
he may interpret
if
for
I pray
in a tongue
the
spirit
of me
prays
the
but
mind
of me
unfruitful
is
what
then
is (this)?
I will pray
with the (my)
spirit
I will pray
and
also
with the (my)
mind
I will sing
with the (my)
spirit
I will sing
and
also
with the (my)
mind
otherwise
if
you praise
in
(your) spirit
the one
occupying
the
place
of the
uninstructed
how
will say
the
amen
at
-
your
giving of thanks
since
what
you say
not
he knows
you
indeed
for
well
give thanks
but
the
other man
not
is not being edified up
I thank
-
God
all
of you
more than
in tongues
I speak
but
in
a church
I want
five
words
with the
mind
of me
to speak
that
also
others
I may instruct
(rahter) than (speak)
ten thousand
words
in
a tongue
brothers
not
children
be
in the (your)
minds
but
-
(as) to malice
be childlike
in the (your)
and
understanding
mature
become
in
the
law
it has been written
-
in
other tongues
and
with
lips
of others
I will speak
-
people
to this
even
not
so
will they hear
me
says
(the) Lord
so then
the
tongues
for
a sign
are
not
to the ones
believing
but
to the
unbelievers
-
but
prophecy
(is) not
to the
unbelievers
but
to the ones
believing.
if
therefore
comes
the
church
whole
together
*
*
and
all
speak
in tongues
enters
and
unlearned ones
or
unbelievers
not
will they say
that
you are out of you minds
if
and
all
prophesy
enter
and
some
unbeliever
or
unlearned one
he is convicted
by
all
he is judged
by
all
the
hidden things
of the
heart
of him
manifest
become
and
so
having fallen
on
(his) face
he will worship
-
God
declaring
that
really
-
God
among
you
is
what (how)
then
is it
brothers
when
you come together
each one
a psalm
has
a taching
has
a revelation
has
a tongue
has
an interpretation
has
all things
for
edification
let be
if
in a tongue
anyone
speaks
by
two
or
the
most
three
and
in
turn
and
one
let interpret
if
but
not
there is
an interpreter
let him be silent
in
an assembly
to himself
and
let him speak
and
-
to God
prophets
and
two
or
three
let them speak
and
the
others
let discern
if
but
to another
(something) is revealed
sitting (by)
the
first
let be silent
you are able
for
one by one

all
to prophesy
that
all
may learn

may be encouraged

not
for
he is
of confusion
the
God
but
of peace
as
in
all
the
churches
of the
saints
the
women
in
the
assemblies
let be silent
not
for
it is permitted
to them
to speak
but
let them be submissive
as
also
the
law
says
if
and
anything
to learn
they desire
in
(the) home
the(ir)
own
husbands
let them ask
a shame
for
it is
for a woman
to speak
in
an assembly
or
from
you
the
word
-
of God
went forth
or
to
you
only
did it reach
if
anyone
thinks
a prophet
to be
or
a spiritual man
let him fully known
the things
I write
to you
that
of (the) Lord
they are
a command
if
but
anyone
does not recognize (this)
he is not recognized
so then
brothers
of me
earnestly desire
-
to prophesy
and
-
to speak
not
do forbid
in tongues
all things
but
decently
and
according to
order
let be done
I make known
now
to you
brothers
the
good news
which
I preached
to you
which
also
you received
in
which
also
you have stood
through
which
also
you are saved
with what
word
I preached
to you
if (provided)
you hold (it) fast
unless
*
*
in vain
you believed.
I handed on
for
to you
among
the first things
that which
also
I received
that
Christ
died
for
the
sins
of us
according to
the
scriptures
and
that
he was buried
and
that
he was raised
on the
day
-
third
according to
the
scriptures
and
that
he was seen
by Cephas
then
by the
twelve
afterward
he was seen
(by) over
five hundred
brothers
at one time
of
whom
the
majority
remain
until
now
some
but
fell asleep
afterward
he was seen
by James
then
by the
apostles
all;
last
and
of all
even as if
to one
untimely born
he was seen
by me also
I
for
am
the
least
of the
apostles
who
is not
*
qualified
to be called
an apostle
because
I persecuted
the
church
-
of God
by grace
but
of God
I am
what
I am
and
the
grace
of him
-
to
me
not
in vain
was
but
more abundantly
than them
all
I labored
not
I
yet
but
the
grace
-
of God
-
with
me
whether
therefore
I
or
those ones
so
we preach
and
so
you believed
if
and
Christ
is being preached
that
from
(the) dead
he has been raised
how
say
among
you
some
that
a resurrection
of dead persons
not
there is
if
and
a resurrection
of dead persons
not
there is
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
and
Christ
not
has been raised
in vain
then
also
(is) the
preaching
of us
in vain
also
the
faith
of you
we are found
and
also
falsewitnesses
-
of God
because
we witnessed
as to
-
God
that
he raised
-
Christ
whom
not
he raised
if
then
dead persons
not
are raised
if
for
dead persons
not
are raised
neither
Christ
has been raised
if
and
Christ
not
has been raised
futile (is)
the
faith
of you
still
you are
in
the
sins
of you
then
also
the ones
having fallen asleep
in
Christ
perished
if
in
-
life
this
in
Christ
hoped
we have
only
to be pitied more
than all
men
we are
now
but
Christ
has been raised
from
(the) dead
(the) firstfruits
of the ones
having fallen asleep
since
for
through
a man
(came) death
also
through
a man
(came) a resurrection
of dead persons
as
for
in
-
Adam
all
die
so
also
in
-
Christ
all
will be made alive
each one
but
in
the (his)
own
order
(the) firstfruits
Christ
afterward
the ones
-
of Christ
in
the
coming
of him
then
the
end
when
he gives over
the
kingdom
-
to God
even
(the) father
when
he abolishes
all
rule
and
all
authority
and
power
it is necessary (for)
for
him
to reign
until
*
he puts
all
the (his)
enemies
under
the
feet
of him
(the) last
enemy
being abolished
-
(is) death
all things
for
he subjected
under
the
feet
of him
when
but
he says
that
all things
have been subjected
(it is) clear
that
(he is) excepted
the one
having subjected
to him
-
all things
when
but
are subjected
to him
-
all things
then
also
himself
the
son
will be subjected
to the one
having subjected
to him
-
all things
that
may be
-
God
-
all things
in
all
otherwise
what
will they do
the ones
being baptized
on behalf of
the
dead
if
at all
dead persons
not
are raised
why
indeed
are they baptized
on behalf of
them
why
also
we
are in danger
every
hour
daily
*
I die
I swear by
-
your
boasting
brohters
which
I have
in
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us.
if
as a mere man
*
I fought with beasts
in
Ephesus
what (is)
to me
the
benefit
if
dead persons
not
are raised
let us eat
and
let us drink
tomorrow
for
we die
not
be deceived
corrupt
morals
good
companionships
bad
come to your senses
(live) righteously
and
not
sin
an ignorance
for
of God
some
have
for
shame
to you
I speak (this)
but
will say
someone
how
are raised
the
dead
with what kind of
and
body
do they come
foolish man
you
what
sow
not
is made alive
if
not
it dies
and
what
you sow
not
the
body
-
going to become
you sow
but
a bare
grain
perhaps
*
of wheat
or
some
of the
other (grains)
-
but
God
gives
to it
a body
as
he wanted
and
to each
of the
seeds
(its) own
body
(is) not
all
flesh
the
same
flesh
but
(there is) another
-
of men
another
and
flesh
of animals
another
and
flesh
of birds
another
and
of fishes
and
(there are) bodies
heavenly
and
bodies
earthly
but
different
*
(is) the
of the
heavenly
glory
different
and
the (glory)
of the
earthly
(there is) another
glory
of (the) Sun
and
another
glory
of (the) moon
and
another
glory
of (the) stars
star
for
from star
differs
in
glory
so
also (is)
the
resurrection
of the
dead
it is sown
in
corruption
it is raised
in
incorruption
it is sown
in
dishonor
it is raised
in
glory
it is sown
in
weakness
it is raised
in
power
it is sown
a body
natural
it is raised
a body
spiritual
if
there is
a body
natural
there is
also
a spiritual one
so
also
it has been written
became
the
first
man
Adam
-
soul
a living
the
last
Adam
-
(became) a sprit
* a life-giving
but
not
first
(is) the
spiritual (body)
but
the
natural
afterward
the
spiritual
the
first
man
(is) out of
earth
made of dust
the
second
man
(is) out of
heaven
as
the man
of dust
such
also
(are) the men
of dust
and
as
the
heavenly man
such
also
(are) the
heavenly ones
and
as
we bore
the
image
of the
man of dust
we will bear
also
the
image
of the
heavenly man
this
now
I say
brothers
that
flesh
and
blood
(the) kingdom
of God
to inherit
not
are able
neither
the
pershable
the
imperishable
inherits
behold
a mystery
to you
I speak
all
not
we will not sleep
all
but
we will be changed
in
a moment
in
a wink
of an eye
in (at)
the
last
trumpet
a trumpet will sound
for
and
the
dead
will be raised
imperishable
and
we
will be changed
it is necessary (for)
for
-
perishable (nature)
this
to put on
(the) imperishable
and
-
mortal (nature)
this
to put on
(the) immortal
when
but
-
perishable (nature)
this
puts on
(the) imperishable
and
-
mortal (nature)
this
puts on
(the) immortal
then
will come to pass
the
word
-
having been written
was swallowed up
-
death
in
victory
where
of you,
(o) death
(is) the
victory
where
of you
(o) death
(is) the
sting
the
now
sting
-
of death
-
(is) sin
the
and
power
-
of sin
(is) the
law
-
but
to God
thanks
the one
giving
us
the
victory
through
the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
so then
brothers
of me
beloved
steadfast ones
be
immovable ones
abounding
in
the
work
of the
Lord
always
knowing
that
the
labor
of you
not
is
in vain
in
(the) Lord
concerning
now
the
collection
-
for
the
saints
as
I directed
the
churches
-
of Galatia
so
also
you
* do
every
first (day)
of a week
each
of you
(at home)
by himself
set (something) aside
storing up
whatever
*
*
he may have prospered in
lest
*
when
I come
then
collections
there should be
when
and
I arrive
whomever
*
you approve
with
letters
these ones
I will send
to carry
the
gift
of you
to
Jerusalem;
if
and
it is ~ fitting
*
-
(for) me also
to go
with
me
they will go
I will come
and
to
you
whenever
Macedonia
I pass through
Macedonia
for
I am passing through
with
you
and
possibly
I will stay
or
even
spend the winter
that
you
me
may send  forward
wherever
*
I may go
not
I desire
for
you
now
in
passing
to see
I hope
for
time
some
to remain
with
you
if
the
Lord
permits
I will remain
but
in
Ephesus
until
-
pentecost
a door
for
to me
has opened
great
and
effective
and
(there are) opposing ones
many
if
now
comes
Timothy
see
that
without fear
he may be
with
you
the
for
works
of (the) Lord
he works
as
I also
(let) not
anyone
therefore
him
despise
send forward
but
him
in
peace
that
he may come
to
me
I am waiting (for)
for
him
with
the
brothers
concerning
now
Apollos
the
brother
greatly
I urged
him
that
he would come
to
you
with
the
brothers
and
altogether
not
it was
(his) desire
that
now
he should come
he will come
but
whenever
he has an opportunity
watch
stand firm
in
the
faith
be men
be strong
all things
of you
in
love
let be done
I urge
now
you
brothers
you know
the
household
of Stephanas
that
it is
(the) firstfruits
-
of Achaia
and
(that) into
a ministry
for the
saints
they put
themselves
that
also
you
may be submissive
-
to such ones
and
to everyone
*
joining in the work
and
laboring
I rejoice
now
at
the
coming
of Stephanas
and
of Fortunatus
and
of Achaicus
because
-
your
deficiency (absence)
these men
filled up
they refreshed
for
-
my
spirit
and
-
of you
give recognition
therefore
-
to such men
greet
you
the
churches
-
of Asia
greet
you
in
(the) Lord
heartily
Aquila
and
Prisca
with
the
in
(the) house
of them
church (meeting)
greet
you
the
brothers
all.
greet
one another
with
kiss
a holy
the
greeting
-
with my own
hand
of Paul
if
anyone
not
love
the
Lord
let him be
a curse
Marana (our Lord)
Tha (come)
the
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
(be) with
you.
the
love
of me
(be) with
all
of you
in
Christ
Jesus
Paul
an apostle
of Christ
Jesus
through
(the) will
of God
and
Timothy
the
brother
to the
church
-
of God
-
being
in
Corinth
with
the
saints
all
-
being
in
all
-
Achaia
grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
(the) father
of us
and
Lord
Jesus
Christ
blessed (be)
the
God
and
father
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
the
father
-
of compassions
and
God
of all
encouragement
the one
encouraging
us
with respect to
all
the
affliction
of us
so as
-
to enable
us
to encourage
the ones
(being) in
every(any)
affliction
through
the
encouragement
by which
we are encouraged
ourselves
by
-
God
because
as
abound
the
sufferings
-
of Christ
to
us
so
through
-
Christ
abounds
also
the
encouragement
of(to) us 
whether
now
we are being afflicted
(it is) for
the
of you
encouragement
and
salvation
or if
we are being encouraged
(it is) for
the
of you
encouragement
-
producing
in (you)
an endurance
of the
same
sufferings
which
also
we
suffer
and
the
hope
of us
(is) firm
for
you
knowing
that
as
sharers
you are
of the
sufferings 
so
also
of the
encouragement
not
for
we want
you
to be ignorant
brothers
as to
the
affliction
of us
-
having happened
in
-
Asia
that
excessively
*
beyond
(our) power
we were burdened
causing
to despair
us
even
-
to live
but
(we) ourselves
in
ourselves
the
sentence
-
of death
have had
that
not
have trust
we should
on
ourselves
but
on
-
God
the one
raising
the
dead
who
out of
so great
a death
delivered
us
and
will deliver
in
whom
we have hoped
that
also
yet
he will deliver
laboring together
also
you
for
us
-
by supplication
that
by
many
persons
(for) the
to
us
gift
through
many
thanks may be given
for
us
the
for
boasting
of us
this
is
the
testimony
of the
conscience
of us
because
in
simplicity
and
sincerity
-
of God
and
not
in
wisdom
fleshly
but
in
(the) grace
of God
we conducted (ourselves)
in
the
world
more especially
and
toward
you
not
for
other things
we write
to you
-
than
what
you read
or
also
know
I hope
and
that
to
(the) end
you will know fully
as
also
you knew
us
in
part
because
boast
of you
we are
even as
also
you
of us
in
the
day
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
and
 this
-
with confidence
I planned
previously
to
you
to come
that
a second
favor
you might have
and
through
you
to pass through
into
Macedonia
and
again
from
Macedonia
to come
to
you
and
by
you
to be sent on
to
-
Judea
this
therefore
planning
(surely) not
then
-
lightness
did I use
or
the things which
I plan
according to
(the) flesh
do I plan
that
there may be
with
me
the
yes
yes
and
the
no
no
faithful
but
-
(is) God
that
the
word
of us
-
to
you
not
is
yes
and
no
the
-
of God
for
son
Jesus
Christ
the one
among
you
by
us
having been preached
through
me
and
Silvanaus
and
Timothy
not
was
yes
and
no
but
yes
in
him
it has (always) been
as many
for
promises
of God (there are)
(there are) in
him
(is) the
yes
wherefore
also
through
him
the
Amen
-
(is) God
for
glory
through
us
the one
but
establishing
us
with
you
in
Christ
and
having anointed
us
(is) God
the one
also
having sealed
us
and
having given
the
earnest
of the
spirit
in
the
hearts
of us
I
now
(as) a witness
-
God
call
upon
-
to my
soul
that
sparing
you
no longer
I came
to
Corinth
not
that
we lord it over
of you
the
faith
but
co-workers
we are
of(for) the
joy
of you
-
for
by faith
you have stood
I decided
for
in myself
this
-
not
again
in
grief
to
you
to come
if
for
I
grieve
you
then
who
(is) the one
cheering
me
except
*
the one
being grieved
by
me
and
I wrote
this very
thing
lest
*
having come
grief
I should have
from
(those) of whom
it was needful
(for) me
to have joy
having confidence
in
all
you
that
-
my
joy
all
of you
is (that)
out of
for
much
affliction
and
distress
of heart
I wrote
to you
with
many
tears
not
that
you should be grieved
but
the
love
that
you may know
which
I  have
more abundantly
for
you
if
now
anyone
has caused grief
not
me
he has grieved
but
in part
*
lest
*
I be too severe
(on) all
you
sufficient
-
to such a man
-
(was) punishment
this
-
by
the
majority
so that
on the contrary
rather (ought)
you
to forgive
and
encourage (him)
lest
*
-
with more abundant
grief
may be swallowed up
-
such a one
therefore
I urge
you
to confirm
to
him
(your) love
to
this (end)
for
also
I wrote
that
I may know
the
proof
of you
if
in
all things
obedient
you are
to whom
now
anything
you forgive
I also
indeed
for
I
what
have forgiven
if
anything
I have forgiven
(it is) because of
you
in
(the) person
of  Christ
lest
*
we should be outsmarted
by
-
Satan
not
for
of his
-
designs
are we ignorant
having come
but
to
-
Troas
for
the
gospel
-
of Christ
and
a door
to me
having been opened
by
(the) Lord
not
I had
rest(peace)
in the
spirit
of me
-
not
(when) I was able to find
*
Titus
the
brother
of me
but
having said farewell
to them
I departed
into
Macedonia.
-
but
to God
thanks
the one
always
leading in triumph
us
in
-
Christ
and
the one
fragrance
of the
knowledge
of  him
manifesting
through
us
in
every
place
because
of Christ
an aroma
we are
-
to God
among
the ones
being saved
and
among
the ones
perishing
to the (latter) ones
-
a fragrance
of
death
unto
death
to the (former) ones
but
a fragrance
of
life
unto
life
and
with respect to
(doing) these things
who
(is) competent
not
for
we are
as
the
many
peddling
the
word
-
of God
but
as
from
sincerity
but
as
from
God
before
God
in
Christ
we speak
do we begin
again
ourselves
to commend
or
(surely) not
we need
as
some (do)
commendatory
letters
to
you
or
from
you
the
letter
of us
you
are
having been written
in
the
hearts
of us
being known
and
being read
by
all
men
being manifested
that
you are
a letter
of (from) Christ
having been cared for
by
us
having been written
not
with ink
but
with (the) spirit
of God
a living
not
in(on)
tablets
of stone
but
in(on)
tablets
(which are) hearts
of flesh
confidence
and
such
we have
through
-
Christ
toward
-
God
not
that
from
ourselves
competent
we are
to  consider
anything
as
of
ourselves
but
the
competence
of us
(is) from
-
God
who
also
made competent
us
(as) ministers
of a new
covenant
not
of letter
but
of  spirit
the
for
letter
kills
the
but
spirit
gives life 
if
now
the
ministry
-
of death
in
letters
having been engraved
in stones
came
with
glory
so that
not
are(were) able
to gaze
the
sons
of Israel
into
the
face
of Moses
because of
the
glory
of the
face
of him
the (glory)
(which) is fading
how
not
rather
the
ministry
of the
spirit
will be
in
glory
if
for
the
ministry
-
of condemnation
(is) glory
much
rather
abounds
the
ministry
-
of righteousness
in glory
for
indeed
not
has been glorified
the thing
having been glorified
in
this
-
respect
on account of
the
surpassing
glory
if
for
the thing (which)
(now) is fading away
(came) with
glory
much
more
the thing
remaining
(is) in
glory
having
therefore
such
hope
with much
boldness
we act
and
(are) not
as
Moses
(who) was putting
a veil
over
the
face
of him
so that
-
not
(were) able to see
the
sons
of Israel
-
the
end
of the thing
fading away
but
were hardened
the
thoughts(minds)
of  them
unti
for
the
present
day
the
same
veil
at
the
reading
of the
old
covenant
remains
not
being unveiled
because
in
Christ
it is being abolished
but
until
today
whenever
*
is being read
Moses
a veil
on
the
heart
of them
lies
whenever
but
*
one turns
to
(the) Lord
is taken away
the
veil
the
now
Lord
the
spirit
is
where
and
the
spirit
of (the) Lord (is)
(there is) freedom
we
now
all
having been unveild
with face
the
glory
of (the) Lord
seeing reflected in a mirror
(into) the
same
image
are being transformed
from
glory
to
glory
even as
from
(the) Lord
(the) spirit
therefore
*
having
-
ministry
this
as
we received mercy
not
we lose heart
but
we renounced
the
hidden things
-
of shame
not
going about
with
cunning
nor
falsifying
the
word
-
of God
but
by the
manifestation
of the
truth
presenting
ourselves
to
every
conscience
of men
before
-
God
if
but
indeed
has been
hidden
the
good news
of us
among
the ones
perishing
it has been
hidden
in
whose (case)
the
god
-
age
of this
blinded
the
thoughts(minds)
of the ones
unbelieving
so as
-
not
to shine forth
the
illumination
of the
good news
of the
glory
-
of Christ
who
is
(the) image
-
God
not
for
ourselves
we preach
but
Jesus
Christ
(the) Lord
ourselves
and
slaves
of you
because of
Jesus
because
-
God
the one
having spoken
out of
darkness
light
will shine
(is) he who
shone
in
the
hearts
of us
for
an illumination
of the
knowledge
of the
glory
-
of God
in
(the) face
of Jesus
Christ
we have
now
-
treasure
this
in
earthen
vessels
that
the
excellence
of the
power
may be
-
of God
and
not
of
us
by
every (side)
being oppressed
but
not
being crushed
being perplexed
but
not
despairing
being persecuted
but
not
being forsaken
being cast down
but
not
being destroyed
always
the
dying
-
of Jesus
in
the (my)
body
bearing about
that
also
the
life
-
of Jesus
in
the
body
of us
might be manifested
always
for
we
the ones
living
to
death
are being given over
because of
Jesus
that
also
the
life
-
of Jesus
may be manisfested
in
the
mortal
flesh
of us
so then
-
death
in
us
works
-
but
life
in
you
having
and
the
same
spirit
-
of faith
according to
the thing
having been written
I believed
therefore
I spoke
both
we
believe
therefore
and
we speak
knowing
that
the one
having raised
the
Lord
Jesus
also
us
with
Jesus
will raise
and
will  present (us)
with
you.
-
for
all things
(are) because of
you
that
the
grace
having increased
through
the
many
the
thanksgiving
may increase
to
the
glory
-
of God
therefore
not
we lose heart
but
if
indeed
the
outward
of us
man
is being decayed
yet
the
inward (man)
of us
is being renewed
day
(by)
day
the
for
present
lightness
of  the
affliction
of us
from
excess
unto
(more) excess
an eternal
weight
of glory
works out
for us
(while) not
looking at
we (are)
the things
being seen
but
the things
not
being seen
the things
for
being seen
(are) temporary
the things
but
not
being seen
(are) eternal
we know
for
that
if
the
earthly
of us
house
of the
tabernacle
is destroyed
a building
from
God
we have
a house
not made with hands
eternal
in
-
heavens
indeed
for
in
this
we groan
the
dwelling
of  us
-
from
heaven
to be clothed with
longing
if
-
indeed
having been unclothed
not
naked
we willl be found
indeed
for
the ones
being
in
the
tabernacle
we groan
being burdened
inasmuch as
*
not
we wish
to be unclothed
but
to be clothed
that
may be swallowed up
the
mortal
by
the
life
the one
now
having made
us
for
very thing
this
(is) God
the one
having given
to us
the
earnest
of the
spirit
being confident
therefore
always
and
knowing
that
being at home
in
the
body
we are away from home
(when) away from
the
Lord
by
faith
for
we walk
not
by
sight
we are confident
then
and
are pleased
rather
to leave home
out from
the(our)
body
and
to be at home
with
the
Lord
therefore
also
we are aspiring
wether
being at home
or
being away from home
well-pleasing
to him
to be
-
for
all (of)
us
to be revealed
it is necessary (for)
before
the
judgment seat
-
of Christ
that
may be recompensed (for)
each one
the things (done)
through
the
body
according to
what things
he practised
whether
good
or
bad
knowing
therefore
the
fear
of the
Lord
men
we persuade
to God
and
we have been made manifest
I hope
and
also
in
the
consciences
of you
to have been made manifest
not
again
ourselves
we commend
to you
but
an opportunity
giving
to you
of(for) a boast
on behalf of
us
that
you may have (such)
toward
the ones
in
appearance
boasting
and
not
in
heart
whether
for
we were beside ourselves
(it was) to God
or
we were in our right mind
(it was) for you
the
for
love
-
of Christ
controls
us
having judged
this
that
one
on behalf of
all
died
then
-
all
died
and
on behalf of
all
he died
that
the ones
living
no longer
to themselves
may live
but
to the one
on behalf of
them
having died
and
having been raised
so that
we
from
-
now (on)
no one
know
according to
flesh
if
indeed
we have known
according to
flesh
Christ
but
now
no longer
we know (him thus)
so that
if
anyone
(is) in
Christ
(he is) a new
creation
the
old things
passed away
behold
he has become
new
-
and
all things
(are) of
-
God
the one
having reconciled
us
to himself
through
Christ
and
having given
to us
the
ministry
-
of reconciliation
that is
(that)
God
was
in
Christ
(the) world
reconciling
to himself
not
reckoning
to them
the
trespasses
of them
and
having put
in
us
the
message
-
of reconciliation
on  behalf of
Christ
therefore
we are ambassadors
as (if)
-
God
(were)  entreating
through
us
we ask
on behalf of
Christ
be reconciled
-
to  God
the one
not
knowing
sin
on behalf of
us
sin
he made
that
we
might become
(the) righteousness
of God
in
him
(as) ones working with (him)
-
also
we urge
not
in
vain
the
grace
-
of God
to receive
you
he says
for
in a time
acceptable
I heard
you
and
in
a day
of salvation
I helped
you
behold
now
(is) a time
acceptable
behold
now
(is) a day
of  salvation
not
in
anything
giving
a cause for stumblling
lest
*
be blamed
the
ministry
but
in
everything
presenting
ourselves
as
of God
servants
in
enduarance
much
in
afflictions
in
hardships
in
distresses
in
beatings
in
imprisonments
in
riots
in
labors
in
watchings
in
fastings
in
purity
in
knowledge
in
longsuffering
in
kindness
in
(the) spirit
holy
in
love
unhypocritical
in
(the) word
of truth
in
(the) power
of God
through
the
weapons
-
of righteousness
of the
right (hand)
and
of (the) left
through
honor
and
dishonor
through
ill repute
and
good repute
as
deceivers
and (yet)
\\"\\"true\\"\\
as
being unknown
and (yet)
being well-known
as
dying
and
behold
we live
as
being punished
and
not
being put to death
as
being grieved
always
but
rejoicing
as
poor
many
but
enriching
as
nothing
having
and (yet)
all things
possessing
the
mouth
of us
has opened
to
you
Corinthians
the
heart
of us
has been enlarged
not
you are being restricted
by
us
you are restricted
but
in
the
bowels(affections)
of you
in the
now
same (kind of)
exchange
as
to children
I speak
be enlarged
also
you
not
become
unequally yoked
with unbelievers
what
for
partnership
(have) righteousness
and
lawlessness
or
what
relationship
(has) light
with
darkness
what
and
harmony
of Chirist
with
Beliar
or
what
part
a believer
with
an unbeliever
what
and
agreement (has)
a sanctuary
of God
with
idols
we
for
a sanctuary
God
are
of a living
as
said
-
God
-
I will dwell
in
them
and
Ｉ will walk among (them)
and
I will be
their
God
and
they
will be
my
people
therefore
come out
from
(the) midst
of  them
and
be separeted
says
(the) Lord
and
an unclean thing
not
touch
and I
will receive
you
and
I will be
to you
-
a father
and
you
will be
to me
-
sons
and
daughters
says
(the) Lord
(the) almighty
these
therefore
having
-
promises
beloved
let us cleanse
ourselves
from
every
defilement
of flesh
and
spirit
perfecting
holiness
in
(the) fear
of God
make room
for us
no one
we wronged
no one
we ruined
no one
we exploited
as to
condemnation
not
I speak
I have said before
for
that
in
the
hearts
of us
you are
so as
-
to die with (you)
and
to live with (you)
I have much
*
boldness
toward
you
I have much
*
boasting
on behalf of
you
I have been filled
-
with encouragement
I am filled to overflowing
-
with joy
at
all
the
affliction
of us
indeed
for
(when) we had come
*
into
Macedonia
no
had
rest
the
body
of us
but
in
every (way)
being afflicted
outside
(were) battles
inside
fears
but
the one
encouraging
the one
lowly
encouraged
us
-
God
by
the
coming
of Titus
not
only
and
by
the
coming
of him
but
also
by
the
encouragement
by which
he was encouraged
over
you
reporting
to us
the
of you
longing
the
of you
mourning
the
of you
zeal
for
me
so that
(it caused) me
more
to rejoice
because
if
indeed
I grieved
you
by
the
letter
not
I regret (it)
if
indeed
I was regretting (it)
I see
for
that
-
letter
that
if
even
for
an hour
grieved
you
now
I rejoice
not
that
you were grieved
but
that
you were grieved
to
repentance
you were grieved
for
according to
God
that
in
nothing
you might suffer loss
by
us
the
for
according to
God
grief
repentance
to
salvation
not to be regretted
works
the
but
of the
world
grief
death
works out
behold
for
same thing
this
-
according to
God
to be grieved
what
it produced
in you
diligence
but
(what) defense
but
(what) indignation
but
(what) fear
but
(what) longing
but
(what) zeal
but
(what) vengeance
in
everything
you presented
yourselves
pure
to be
in the
matter
then
if
indeed
I wrote
to you
(it was) not
for the sake
of the one
having done wrong
nor
for the sake of
the one
having been wronged
but
for the sake of
-
being made manifest
the
zeal
of you
-
for
us
to
you
before
-
God
because of
this
we have been encouraged
as to
but
the
encouragement
of us
exceedingly
more
we rejoiced
at
the
joy
of Titus
because
has been set at rest
the
spirit
of him
from(by)
all
you
because
if
anything
to him
about
you
I have boasted
not
I was put to shame
but
as
all things
in
truth
we spoke
to you
so
also
the
boasting
of us
-
as to
Titus
truth
became
and
the
bowels(affections)
of him
more abundantly
toward
you
are
remembering
the
all
of you
obedience
as
with
fear
and
trembling
you received
him
I rejoice
that
in
everything
I have confidence
in
you
we make known
now
to you
brothers
the
grace
-
of God
-
having been given
among
the
churches
-
of Macedonia
that
by
a great
test
of affliction
the
abundance
of the
joy
of  them
and
the
extreme
depth
of (the) poverty
of them
abounded
to
the
riches
of the
generosity
of them
that
according to
(their) ability
I testify
and
beyond
(their) ability
of their own accord
with
much
appeal
requesting
of us (to receive)
the
favor
and
(to participate in) the
contribution
of the
ministry
-
to
the
saints
and
not
as
we hoped
but
themselves
they gave
first
to the
Lord
and
to us
through
(the) will
of God
so that
-
to ask
(it was necessary for) us
Titus
that
as
he began before
so
also
he should complete
among
you
also
-
(act of) grace
this
but
just as
in
everything
you abound
in faith
and
in word
and
in knowledge
and
in all
diligence
and
in the
from
us
to
you
love
(see) that
also
in
this
-
grace
you abound
not
according to
a command
I speak
but
through
the
of others
diligence
and
the
-
of your
love
genuineness
testing
you know
for
the
grace
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
that
because of
you
he became poor
rich
(though) being
that
you
by the
of that one
poverty
may become rich
and
an opinion
in
this
I give
this
for
for you
is profitable
who
not
only
the
doing
but
also
the
willing
you previously began
from
last year
now
but
also
the
doing
complete
so
just as
(there was) the
eagerness
of(for) the
willingness
so
also
the
completing
of
what
(you) have
if
for
the
eagerness
is already present
according to
whatever
one may have
(it is) exceptable
not
according to
not
(what) one has
not
for
that
to others
(there be) relief
(and) to you
distress
but
by
equality
during
the
present
time
the
of you
abundance
for
the
of those ones
lack
that
also
the
of those ones
abundance
may be
for
the
of you
lack
so
there may be
equality
as
it has been written
the one (that gathered)
the much
much
not
had too much
and
the one (that gathered)
the
little
not
had too little
thanks (be)
but
-
to God
the one
having given
the
same
diligence
for
you
in
the
heart
of Titus
because
the
*
encouragement
he received
more diligent
and
being
of his own accord
he went forth
to
you
we sent
and
with
him
the
brother
of whom
the
praise
in
the
gospel
(is) through(out)
all
the
churches
not
only (this)
and
but
also
having been handpicked
by
the
churches
(as) a traveling companion
of us
with
-
(gracious) gift
this
-
being administered
by
us
to
the
himself
of the
Lord
glory
and
(a testimony of the) eagerness
of us
avoiding
this
lest
anyone
us
should blame
in
-
abundance
this
-
being administered
by
us
we have regard for
for
good things
not
only
before
(the) Lord
but
also
before
men
we sent with
and
them
the
brother
of us
whom
we approved
in
many things
many times
diligent
being
now
and
(being) much
more diligent
by (his) confidence
great
-
in
you
whether
as regards
Titus
(he is) partner
my
and
for
you
a co-worker
or
brothers
of us
(they are) apostles
of churches
(the) glory
of Christ
the
therefore
demonstration
of the
love
of you
and
of us
boasting
about
you
to
them
(be) displaying (these)
in
(the) presence
of the
churches
concerning
-
for
the
service
-
for
the
saints
superfluous
for me
it is
-
to write
to you
I know
for
the
eagerness
of you
which
on behalf of
you
I boast
to Macedonians
that
Achaia
has been prepared
since
last year
and
the
of you
zeal
stirred up
the
many
I sent
and
the
brothers
that
not
the
boast
of us
-
on behalf of
you
should be made empty
in
-
respect
this
that
as
I was saying
having been prepared
you were
lest
perhaps
if
should  come
with
me
Macedonians
and
they find
you
unprepared
should be ashamed
we
that
not
we should say
you
in
-
confidence
this
necessary
therefore
I considered (it)
to encourage
the
brothers
that
they should go before
to
you
and
having arranged beforehand
the
having been previously promised
blessing (gift)
by you
this (gift)
ready
to be
so
as
(to be) a blessing
and
not
as
an exaction
this
and
the one
sowing
sparingly
sparingly
also
will reap
and
the one
sowing
for
a blessing (bounty)
-
a blessing (bounty)
also
will reap
each one
as
he has decided previously
in the(his)
heart
not
out of
grief
nor
out of
necessity
cheerful
for
giver
loves
-
God
is able
and
-
God
all
grace
to cause to abound
to
you
that
in
everything
always
all
sufficiency
having
you may abound
to
every
work
good
as
it has been written
he scattered
he gave
to the
poor
the
righteousness
of him
remains
to
the
age
the one
now
supplying
seed
to the one
sowing
both
bread
for
food
will supply
and
will multiply
the
seed
of you
and
will increase
the
fruits
of the
righteousness
of you
in
everything
being enriched
to
all
generosity
which
produces
through
us
thanksgiving
-
to God
because
the
ministry
-
service
of this
not
only
is
filling up
the things
lacking
of the
saints
but
(is) also
abounding
through
many
thanksgiving
-
to God
through
the
proof
-
ministry
of this
glorifying
-
God
on (the basis of)
the(your)
submission
of(to) the
confession
of you
to
the
gospel
-
of Christ
and
(on the) generosity
of the
contribution
to
them
and
to
all men
and (also)
their
supplication
for
you
having great affection for
you
because of
the
surpassing
grace
-
of God
upon
you
thanks
-
(be) to God
for
the
indescribable
of him
gift
myself
now
I
Paul
appeal
to you
through
the
humility
and
gentleness
-
of Christ
who
according to
appearance
-
(am) lowly
among
you
being absent
but
am bold
toward
you
I request
now
-
not
being present
to be bold
in the
confidence
which
I consider
to be daring
toward
some people
the ones
considering
us
as
according to
flesh
walking
(though) in
flesh
for
walking
not
according to
flesh
we war
the
for
weapons
of the
warfare
of us
(are) not
fleshly
but
powerful
-
through God
to
(the) overthrow
of strongholds
reasonings
overthrowing
and
every
high thing
rising up
against
the
knowledge
-
of God
and
leading captive
every
thought
into
the
obedience
-
of Christ
and
in
readiness
having
to avenge
all
disobedience
whenever
is fulfilled
of you
the
obedience
the things
according to
appearance
you look (at)
if
anyone
has persuaded
himself
of Christ
to be
this
let him consider
again
as to
himself
that
as
he (is)
of Christ
so
also
we (are)
if
even
for
more abundantly
something
I should boast
about
the
authority
of us
which
gave
the
Lord
for
building up
and
not
for
(the) overthrow
of you
not
I will be put to shame
that
not
I may seem
as
if
to frighten
you
through
the(my)
letters
because
the(his)
epistles
indeed
he says
(are) weighty
and
strong
the
but
presence
of the(his)
body
(is) weak
and
the(his)
speech
(is) being despised
this
let consider
-
such a one
that
such as
we are
-
in word
through
letters
being absent
such ones
also (we are)
being present
-
in deed
not
for
dare we
to classify
or
to compare
ourselves
with some
of the ones
themselves
commending
but
they
among
themselves
themselves
measuring
and
comparing
themselves
with themselves
not
understand
we
but
not
to
the things
beyond measure
will boast
but
according to
the
measure
of the
sphere
which
apportioned
to us
-
God
(by a) measure
to reach
as far as
even
you
not
for
as
not
reaching
to
you
do we overextend
ourselves,
as far as
for
even
you
we came
with
the
gospel
-
of Christ;
not
in
the things
beyond measure
boasting
in
of others
(the) labors
hope
but
having
(while is) growing
the
faith
of you
among
you
to be enlarged
according to
the
sphere
of us
(resulting) in
abundance
to
the (regions)
beyond
you
to preach good news
not
in
another's
sphere
as to
things
already done
to boast
the one
but
boasting
in
(the) Lord
let him boast
not
for
the one
himself
commending
that one
is
approved
but
whom
the
Lord
commends
I would (that)
you were bearing with
me
in a little bit
*
of foolishness
but
indeed
you do bear with
me
I am jealous
for
for you
of God
with a jealousy
I betrothed
for
you
to one
husband
a virgin
pure
to present (you)
-
to Christ
I fear
but
lest
somehow
as
the
serpent
deceived
Eve
by
the
cunning
of him
should be led astray
the
thoughts
of you
from
the
simplicity
and
the
purity
-
in
-
Christ
if
indeed
for
the one
coming
another
Jesus
preaches
whom
not
we preached
or
a spirit
different
you receive
which
not
you received
or
a gospel
different
which
not
you received
well (enough)
you put up with (that)
I consider
for
nothing
to have come behind
the
super-
apostles
if
but
indeed
(I am) unskilled
-
in speech
yet
not
-
in knowledge
but
in
every (way)
having manifested (this)
in
all things
to
you
or
a sin
did I commit
myself
(by) humbling
that
you
might be exalted
because
gratuitously
the
-
of God
good news
I proclaimed
to you  
other
churches
I robbed
having taken
wages
for
the
of(to) you
service
and
being present
with
you
and
having been lacking
not
I burdened
anyone
the
for
lack
of me
made up
the
brothers
having come
from
Macedonia
and
in
every (way)
unburdensome
myself
to you
I kept
and
I will keep
is
(the) truth
of Christ
in
me
that
-
boasting
this
not
will be silenced
in
me
in
the
regions
-
of Achaia
why
*
because
not
I love
you
-
God
knows
what
but
I do
also
I will do
that
I may cut off
the
opportunity
of the ones
wanting
an opportunity
that
in
which
they (could) boast
they may be found
as
also
we (are)
-
for
such ones
(are) false apostles
workers
deceitful
transforming themselves
into
apostles
of Christ
and
no
wonder
himself
for
-
Satan
transforms himself
into
an angel
of light
(it is) no
great thing
therefore
if
also
the
ministers
of him
transform themselves
as
ministers
of righteousness
of whom
the
end
will be
according to
the
works
of them
again
I say
not
anyone
me
should think
foolish
to be
if
but
otherwise
*
even if
as
foolish
receive
me
that
I also
a little bit
*
may  boast
what
I speak
not
according to
(the) Lord
I speak
but
as
in
foolishness
in
this
-
confidence
-
of boasting
since
many
boast
according to
flesh
I also
will boast
gladly
for
you put up with
the
fools
intelligent
being
you put up with (it)
for
if
anyone
you
brings into bondage
if
anyone
devours (you)
if
anyone
takes (from you)
if
anyone
exalts himself
if
anyone
in
(the) face
you
hits
to
(my) shame
I speak
that (in this)
*
we
have been weak
in
what (way)
but
ever
anyone
may be daring
in
foolishness
I speak
am daring
I also
Hebrews
are they
I also
Israelites
are they
I also
seed
of Abraham
are they
I also
ministers
of Christ
are they
(as) being out of (my) mind
I speak
more
I
in
labors
more abundantly
in
imprisonments
more frequently
in
beatings
far more
in
deaths
often
by
Jews
five times
forty (lashes)
less
one
I received
three times
I was beaten with rods
one time
I was stoned
three times
I was shipwrecked
a night and a day
in
the
deep
I have been
in journeys
often
in dangers
of rivers
in dangers
of robbers
in dangers
from
(my own) race
in dangers
from
gentiles
in dangers
in
(the)  city
in dangers
in
(the) wilderness
in dangers
in
(the) sea
in dangers
among
false brothers
in labor
and
toil
in
watchings
often
in
famine
and
thirst
in
fastings
often
in
cold
and
nakedness
beside
the things
(from) without
the
pressure
to me
-
day by day
* (day)
the
care
of all
the
churches
who
is weak
and
not
I am weak
who
is caused to sin
and
not
I
burn
if
to boast
it is necessary
the things
of the
weakness
of me
I will boast
the
God
and
father
of the
Lord
Jesus
knows
the one
being
blessed
into
the
ages
that
not
I am lying
in
Damascus
the
ethnarch
of Aretas
the
king
was guarding
the
city
of (the) Damascenes
to arrest
me
and
through
a window
in
a basket
I was let down
through
the
wall
and
escaped
the
hands
of him
to boast
it is necessary (for me)
not
profitable
though
I will come
but
to
visions
and
revelations
of (the) Lord
I know
a man
in
Christ
before
years
fourteen
whether
in
(the) body
not
I know
or
out of
the
body
not
I know
-
God
knows
having been caught away
-
such a one
to
(the) third
heaven
and
I know
-
such
a man
whether
in
(the) body
or
outside
the
body
not
I know
-
God
knows
that
he was caught away
into
-
paradise
and
heard
inexpressible
words
which
not
it is permitted
for man
to speak 
on behalf of
-
such a one
I will boast
on behalf of
but
myself
not
I will boast
except
*
in
the(my)
weakness
if
for
I desire
to boast
not
I will be
foolish
truth
for
I will speak
I spare (you)
but
lest
anyone
to
me
gives credit
beyond
what
he sees (in)
me
or
hears
something
of
me
and
by the
excess
of the (my)
revelations
therefore
that
not
I should be too exalted
there was given
to me
a thorn
in the
flesh
a messenger
of  Satan
that
me
he might beat
that
not
I should be too exalted
as to
this
three times
the
Lord
I called upon
that
it might depart
from
me
and
he has said
to me
is sufficient
for you
the
grace
of me
the (my)
for
power
in
weakness
is perfected
most gladly
therefore
rather
I will boast
in
the
weakness
of me
that
might be a shelter
over
me
the
power
-
of Christ
wherefore
I take pleasure
in
weakness
in
insults
in
hardships
in
persecutions
and
distresses
on behalf of
Christ
whenever
for
I am weak
then
powerful
I am
I have become
foolish
you
me
compelled
I
for
ought
by
you
to be commended
(in) nothing
for
I was behind
the
super
apostles
if
even
nothing
I am
the
indeed
signs
of the
apostle
were performed
among
you
in
all
endurance
by signs
both
and
wonders
and
works of power
what
for
is it
that
you were less
than
the
rest (of the)
churches
if
not
that
myself
I
not
was a burden
(on) you
forgive
me
-
wrong
this
behold
(the) third (time)
this (is)
ready
I am
to come
to
you
and
not
I will be a burden
not
for
I seek
the things
of you
but
you
not
for
ought
the
children
for the
parents
to treasure (save) up
but
the
parents
for the
children
I
but
most gladly
will spend
and
will be utterly spent
for
the
souls
of you
if
more abundantly
you
I love
less
am I (to be) loved
let it be
but
I
not
burdened
you
but
being
crafty
with deceit
you
I took
(surely) not
any
of  whom
I have sent
to
you
through
him
did I exploit
you
I urged
Titus (to go)
and
I sent with (him)
the
brother
(surely) not
exploited
you
Titus
not
by the
same
spirit
walked we
not
in the
same
steps
all along
are you thinking
that
to you
we are making a defense
before
God
in
Christ
we speak
-
but
all things
beloved
(are) for
the
of you
edification
I fear
for
lest
perhaps
having come
not
such as
I wish
I may find
you
and I
may be found
by you
such as
not
you wish
lest
perhaps
(there be) strife
jealousy
anger
factions
slander
gossip
conceit
commotions
lest
again
having come
my
may make humble
me
the
God
of me
before
you
and
I should mourn
many
of the ones
having sinned before
and
not
having repented
over
the
uncleanness
and
fornication
and
debauchery
which
they practised
(the) third time
this (is)
I am coming
to
you
on(by)
(the) mouth
of two
witnesses
and
of three
will be established
every
word
I have foretold
and
I say beforehand
as
being present
the
second (time)
and
being absent
now
to the ones
having sinned previously
and
to the
rest
all
that
if
I come
to (you)
-
again
not
I will spare
since
a proof
you seek
-
in
me
speaking
of Christ
who
toward
you
not
is weak
but
powerful
in
you
indeed
for
he was crucified
out of
weakness
but
he lives
by
(the) power
of God
indeed
for
we
are weak
in
him
but
we will live
with
him
by
(the) power
of God
toward
you
yourselves
test
if
you are
in
the
faith
yourselves
prove
or
not
you realize
yourselves
that
Jesus
Christ
(is) in
you
if
not
unapproved
you are
I hope
but
that
you will know
that
we
not
are
unapproved
we pray
now
to
-
God
not
to do
you
evil
not any
not
that
we
approved
may appear
but
that
you
the
good
may do
we
and
as
unapproved
may be
not
for
we are able (to do)
anything
against
the
truth
but
for
the
truth
we rejoice
for
when
we
are weak
you
and
strong
are
this
also
we pray
the
of you
perfection
because of
this
these things
being absent
I write
that
being present
not
with severity
I may treat (you)
according to
the
authority
which
the
Lord
gave
me
for
edification
and
not
for
destruction
for the rest
brothers
rejoice
be restored
be encouraged
the
same thing
think
be at peace
and
the
God
-
of love
and
peace
will be
with
you
greet
one another
with
a holy
kiss
greet
you
the
saints
all
the
grace
of the
Lord
Jesus
Christ
and
the
love
-
of God
and
the
fellowship
of the
Holy
Spirit
(be) with
all
you
Paul
an apostle
not
from
men
nor
through
man
but
through
Jesus
Christ
and
God
(the) Father
the one
having raised
Him
from
(the) dead,
and
the
with
me
all
brothers
to the
churches
-
of Galatia;
grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
(the) father
of us
and
(the) Lord
Jesus
Christ,
the one
having given
Himself
on behalf of
the
sins
of us
so that
he might rescue
us
out of
the
age
-
present
evil
according to
the
will
-
of God
even
(the) father
of us
to whom
(be) the
glory
into
the
ages
of the
ages
Amen.
I marvel
that
so
quickly
you are being turned
from
the one
having called
you
in(by)
(the) grace
of  Christ
to
a different
gospel
which
not
is
another
except
*
some
there are
-
troubling
you
and
(are) desiring
to pervert
the
gospel
-
Christ
But
even
if
we
or
an angel
from
Heaven
should preach a gospel
to you
besides
that which
we preached
to you
a curse
let him be
As
we have previously said
and
now
again
I say
if
anyone
to you
preaches a gospel
besides
that which
you received
a curse
let him be
now
For
men
am I trying to convince
or
-
God
Or
am I seeking
men
to please
If
still
men
I were pleasing
of Christ
a slave
not
*
I would be
I make known
for
to you
brothers
the
gospel
-
having been preached
by
me
that
not
it is
according to
man
neither
For
I
from
man
received
it
nor
was I taught (it)
but
through
a revelation
of Jesus
Christ
you heard (of)
For
-
my
manner of life
once
in
-
Judaism
*
excessively
*
I was persecuting
the
church
-
of God
and
ravaging
it
and
I was advancing
in
-
Judaism
beyond
many
comtemporaries
in
the
nation
of me
more abundantly
a zealot
being
the
ancestral
of me
traditions
when
But
was pleased
-
God
the one
having separated
me
from
(the) womb
of (the) mother
of me
and
having called (me)
through
the
grace
of him
to reveal
the
Son
of Him
in
me
that
I might preach
Him
among
the
gentiles
immediately
not
I consulted
with flesh
and
blood
nor
did I go up
to
Jerusalem
to
the
before
me
apostles
but
I went away
into
Arabia
and
again
I returned
to
Damascus
Then
after
years
three
I went up
to
Jerusalem
to get acquainted with
Cephas
and
I stayed
with
him
days
fifteen
other
But
of the
apostles
not
I saw
except
*
James
the
brother
of the
Lord
what things
now
I write
to you
behold
before
-
God
*
not
I lie
Then
I went
into
the
regions
-
of Syria
and
-
of Cilicia
I was
but
unknown
-
in person
by the
churches
-
of Judea
-
in
Christ
only
and
hearing
they were
that
the one
persecuting
us
once
now
is preaching
the
faith
which
once
he was ravaging
And
they were glorifying
in
me
-
God
Then
after
fourteen
years
again
I went up
to
Jerusalem
with
Barnabas
having taken with (me)
also
Titus
I went up
yet
according to
a revelation
and
I laid before
them
the
gospel
which
I proclaim
among
the
gentiles
privately
*
but
to the ones
seeming (to be something)
lest
somehow
in
vain
I should run
or
did run
But
not
Titus
the one
with
me
a Greek
being
was compelled
to be circumcised
because of
but
the
secretly brought in
false brothers
who
crept in
to spy out
the
freedom
of us
which
we have
in
Christ
Jesus
that
us
they might enslave
to whom
not
for
an hour
did we yield
-
in subjection
that
the
truth
of the
gospel
might continue
with
you
from
But
the ones
seeming
to be
something
of what kind
once
they were
nothing
to me
matters
(the) face
-
God
of a person
not
accepts
to me
for
the ones
seeming (to be something)
nothing
added
but
on the contrary
having seen
that
I have been entrusted (with)
the
gospel
of(for) the
uncircumcision
as
Peter
of(for) the
circumcision
the one
for
having worked
in Peter
for
an apostleship
of the
circumcision
worked
also
in me
for
the
gentiles
and
realizing
the
grace
-
having been given
to me
James
and
Cephas
and
John
the ones
seeming
pillars
to be
(the) right hands
gave
to me
and
Barnabas
of fellowship
that
we (should be)
for
the
gentiles
they
but
for
the
circumcision
only
the
poor
that
we should remember
which
also
I was eager
very 
this thing
to do
when
But
came
Cephas
to
Antioch
to
(his) face
him
I stood against
because
comdemned
he had been
before
-
For
came
certain ones
from
James
with
the
gentiles
he was eating
when
but
they came
he was drawing back
and
was separating
himself
fearing
the ones
of
(the) circumcision
And
joined in pretense
with him
also
the
rest
of (the) Jews
so that
also
Barnabas
was carried away with
of them
the
hypocrisy
But
when
I saw
that
not
they walked correctly
with respect to
the
truth
of the
gospel
I said
-
to Cephas
before
all
If
you
a Jew
being
as a gentile
and
not
as a Jew
live
how
the
gentiles
do you compel
to live as Jews
We
by nature
Jews
and
not
of
(the) gentiles
sinners
knowing
-
that
not
is justified
a man
by
works
of law
but
*
through
faith
of (in) Jesus
Christ
and
we
in
Christ
Jesus
believed
that
we might be justified
by
faith
of (in) Christ
and
not
by
works
of law
that
by
works
of law
not
will be justified
all (any)
flesh
if
now
seeking
to be justified
in
Christ
we were found
also
(our)selves
sinners (to be)
then
(is) Christ
of sin
a minister
never
may it be
if
For
what
I destroyed
these things
again
I build
a transgressor
myself
I demonstrate (to be)
I
For
through
law
to law
died
that
to God
I may live
with Christ
I have been crucified
I am living
but
no longer
(as) I
lives
but
in
me
Christ
that which
and
now
I live
in
(the) flesh
in(by)
faith
I live
that
of the
Son
-
of God
the one
having loved
me
and
having given over
Himself
on behalf of
me
not
I set aside
the
grace
-
of God
if
for
through
law
righteousness (is)
then
Christ
for nothing
died
O
senseless
Galatians
who
you
bewitched
whose
before
eyes
Jesus
Christ
was openly portrayed
(as) having been crucified
This
only
I want
to learn
from
you
by
works
of law
the
Spirit
you received
or
by
(the) hearing
of(with) faith
so
senseless
you are
having begun
in (the) spirit
now
in (the) flesh
are you being perfected
so many things
did you suffer
in vain
If
really
indeed
in vain
the one
therefore
supplying
to you
the
Spirit
and
producing
works of power
among
you
(is it) by
works
of law
or
by
(the)  hearing
of(with) faith
as
Abraham
believed
-
God
and
it was accounted
to him
for
righteousness
Know
then
that
the ones
of
faith
these ones
sons
are
of Abraham
having foreseen
And
the
Scripture
that
by
faith
would justify
the
nations
-
God
preached the good news before
-
Abraham
-
will be blessed
in
you
all
the
nations
so
the ones
of
faith
are blessed
with
the
believing
Abraham
as many as
For
of
works
of law
are
under
a curse
are
it has been written
for
-
Cursed (is)
everyone
who
not
abides
by all
the things
having been wirtten
in
the
book
of the
law
-
to do
them
that
now
by
law
no one
is being justified
before
-
God
(is) clear
because
The
just
by
faith
will live
the
but
law
not
is
of
faith
but
the one
having done
these things
will live
in
them
Christ
us
redeemed
from
the
curse
of the
law
having become
on behalf of
us
a curse
because
it has been written
Cursed (is)
everyone
-
having hung
on
a tree
that
to
the
nations
the
blessing
-
of Abraham
might come
in(by)
Christ
Jesus
that
the
promise
of the
Spirit
we might receive
through
-
faith
brothers
according to
man
I speak
even
by man
having been confirmed
a covenant
no one
sets aside
or
adds to (it)
-
now
to Abraham
were spoken
the
promises
and
to the
Seed
of him
Not
he says
And
to the
seeds
as
concerning
many
but
as
concerning
one
And
to the
Seed
of you
who
is
Christ
this
And
I say
A covenant
having been previously  confirmed
by
-
God
the
after
four hundred
and
thirty
years
having come into being
Law
not
annuls

the
generations
of the
age
of the
ages
Amen
I encourage
Therefore
you
I
the
prisoner
in
(the) Lord
worthy
to walk
of the
calling
by which
you were called
with
all
humility of mind
and
meekness
with
longsuffering
forbearing
one another
in
love
being eager
to keep
the
oneness
of the
Spirit
in
the
uniting bond
-
of peace
(as there is) one
body
and
one
spirit
as
also
you were called
in(with)
one
hope
of the
calling
of you
one
Lord
one
faith
one
baptism
one
God
and
Father
of all
the one
over
all
and
through
all
and
in
all
one
But
to each
of us
was given
-
grace
according to
the
measure
of the
gift
-
of Christ
wherefore
it says
having ascended
to
(the) height
He led captive
captivity
he gave
gifts
-
to men
(as to) the
now
he ascended
what
is (it)
except
*
that
also
he descended
into
the
lower
parts
of the
earth
the one
having descended
Himself
is
also
the one
having ascended
far above
all
the
heavens
that
He might fill
-
all things
And
He
gave
some
-
apostles
some
and
prophets
some
and
evangelists
some
and
shepherds
and
teachers
for
the
equipping
of the
saints
to
(the) works
of ministry
to
(the) building up
of the
body
-
of Christ
until
we arrive
-
all
at
the
unity
of the
faith
and
(at) the
fuller knowledge
of the
Son
-
of God
at
a man
of complete maturity
at
(the) measure
of (the) stature
of the
fullness
-
of Christ
that
no longer
we should be
infants
tossed by waves
and
carried around
by every
wind
-
of teaching
by
the
cunning
-
of men
with
craftiness
(leading) to
the
scheming
-
of deception
holding to truth
but
in
love
let us grow up
into
him
-
(in) all things
who
is
the
head
Christ
out from
whom
all
the
body
being fitly joined together
and
being united
through
every
joint
of the
supply
according to
(the) working
in
(the) measure
single
of each
part
the
growth
of the
body
makes
unto
(the) building up
of itself
in
love
this
Therefore
I say
and
testify
in
(the) Lord
no longer
(are) you
to walk
as
also
the
gentiles
walk
in
(the) futility
of the
minds
of them
darkened
in the
understanding
being
having been alienated from
the
life
-
of God
because of
the
ingnorance
-
existing
in
them
because of
the
hardness
of the
hearts
of them
who
having put away remorse
themselves
gave
-
to lewdness
for
(the) practise
impurity
of every (kind of)
with
greediness
you
But
not
so
learned
-
Christ
if
indeed
Him
you heard
and
in
Him
were taught
as
is
truth
in
-
Jesus
to put off
(for) you
as concerning
the
former
manner of life
the
old
man
the one
being corrupted
according to
the
lusts
-
of deceit
to be renewed
and
by the
spirit
(controling) the
mind
of you
and
to put on
the
new
man
the one
according to
God
having been created
in
righteousness
and
sanctity
of the
truth
wherefore
having put off
-
falsehood
let us speak
truth
each one
with
the
neighbor
of him
because
we are
one of another
members
Be angry
and
not
sin
the
sun
not
let set
on
the
anger
of you
neither
give
place
to the
devil
the one
stealing
no longer
let him steal
rather
but
let him labor
working
-
with his own
hands
(at) something
good
that
he may have (something)
to share with
the one
need
having
every(any)
word
corrupt
from
the
mouth
of you
not
should proceed
but
if
any
good (word)
(let it be) for
edification
in  accordnce with the
need
that
it may give
grace
to the ones
hearing
And
not
grieve
the
Spirit
-
Holy
-
of God
by
whom
you were sealed
for
(the) day
of redemption
(let)  all
bitterness
and
anger
and
wrath
and
clamor
and
slander
be removed
from
you
with
all
evil
be
and
to
one another
kind
tenderhearted
forgiving
each other
as
also
-
God
in(by)
Christ
forgave
you
be
therefore
imitators
-
of God
as
children
beloved
and
walk
in
love
as
also
-
Christ
loved
us
and
gave up
Himself
on behalf of
us
(as)  an offering
and
sacrifice
-
to God
for
a fragrance
of sweet smell
fornication
for
and
impurity
all
or
greediness
not
let be named
among
you
as
is proper (for)
saints
also
indecency
and
foolish talking
or
coarse jesting
which
not
are fitting
but
rather
thanksgiving
this
For
you know
(by) recognizing
that
every
fornicator
or
impure person
or
covetous person
that
is
an idolater
not
have
an inheritance
in
the
kingdom
-
of Christ
and
of God
no one
you
let deceive
with empty
words
because of
these things
for
comes
the
wrath
-
of God
upon
the
sons
-
of disobedience
not
therefore
be
joint-partakers
with  them
you were
for
once
darkness
now
but
light
in
(the) Lord
as
children
of light
walk
the
for
fruit
of the
light
(is) in
all
goodness
and
righteousness
and
truth
proving
what
is
well-pleasing
to the
Lord
and
not
participate
in  the
works
-
unfruitful
-
of darkness
rather
but
even
expose (them)
(as to) the things
For
in secret
being done
by
them
shameful
it is
even
to speak (of them)
-
But
everything
being exposed
by
the
light
becomes visible
every(any)thing
for
-
becoming visible
light
is
Therefore
it says
Arise
the one
sleeping
and
rise up
from
the
dead
and
will shine on
you
-
Christ
see
Therefore
carefully
how
you walk
not
as
unwise
but
as
wise
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
evil
are
therefore
*
not
be
foolish
but
understand
what
the
will
of the
Lord (is)
And
not
become drunk
with wine
in
which
is
dissipation
but
be filled
in(by)
(the) spirit
speaking
to one another
in
psalms
and
hymns
and
songs
spiriitual
singing
and
making melody
in the
heart(s)
of you
to the
Lord
gving thanks
always
for
all things
in
(the) name
of the
Lord
of us
Jesus
Christ
-
to God
even
(the) father
being submissive
to one another
in
(the) fear
of Christ
The
wives
-
to their own
husbands
as
to the
Lord
because
a husband
is
head
of the
wife
as
also
-
Christ
(is) head
of the
church
(being) himself
(the) savior
of the
body
But
as
the
church
is submissive
-
to Christ
so
also
the
wives
to the(ir)
husbands
in
everything
The
husbands
love
the(your)
wives
as
also
-
Christ
loved
the
church
and
Himself
gave up
on behalf of
her
that
her
he might sanctify
having cleansed (her)
by the
washing
of the
water
in
(the) word
that
might present
he
to Himself
a glorious
-
church
not
having
spot
or
wrinkle
or
any
-
such things
but
that
she may be
holy
and
blemishless
So
ought
also
the
husbands
to  love
-
their own
wives(wife)
as
-
their own
bodies(body)
the one
loving
-
his own
wife
himself
loves
no one
for
ever
-
his own
flesh
hated
but
nourishes
and
cherishes
it
as
also
-
Christ
(to) the
church
because
members
we are
of the
body
of him
because of
this
will leave
a man
the(his)
father
and
the(his)
mother
and
will be joined
to
the
wife
of him
and
will be
the
two
-
flesh
one
-
mystery
This
great
is
I
but
speak
as to
Christ
and
as to
the
church
nevertheless
also
you
-
one by one
*
each
-
his own
wife
so
let love
as
himself
the
and
wife
that
she respects
the(her)
husband
The
children
obey
the
parents
of you
in
(the) Lord
this
for
is
right
Honor
the
father
of you
and
the(your)
mother
which
is
commandment
(the) first
with
a promise
that
well
with you
it may be
and
you will be
a long time
on
the
earth
And
the
fathers
not
make angry
the
children
of you
but
nurture
them
in
(the) training
and
admonition
of (the) Lord
The
slaves
obey
the(your)
according to
flesh
masters
with
fear
and
trembling
in
singleness
of the
heart
of you
as
-
Christ
not
by way of
eye-service
as
men-pleasers
but
as
slaves
of Christ
doing
the
will
-
of God
from
(the) soul
with
goodwill
doing service
as
to the
Lord
and
not
to men
knowing
that
each man
whatever
*
he does
good thing
this
he will receive
from
(the) Lord
whether
a slave
or
a freeman
And
the
masters
the
same things
do
towards
them
forbearing
-
threatening
knowing
that
both
their
and
of you
the
Lord
is
in
(the) heavens
and
respect of persons
not
there is
with
him
(for) the
rest
be continually empowered
in
(the) Lord
and
in
the
might
of the
strength
of him
Put on
the
whole armor
-
of God
for
-
to be able
you
to stand
against
the
schemes
of the
devil
Because
not
is
to us
the
wrestling
against
blood
and
flesh
but
against
the
rulers
against
the
authorities
against
the
world powers
-
of darkness
this
against
the
spritual forces
-
of evil
in
the
heavenlies
therefore
*
take up
the
whole armor
-
of God
that
you may be able
to withstand
in
the
day
-
evil
and
all
having done
to stand
stand
Therefore
having girded
the
waist
of you
with
truth
and
having put on
the
breastplate
-
of righteousness
and
having put shoes on
the(your)
feet
with
(the) firm footing
of the
good news
-
of peace
with
all (these) things
having taken up
the
shield
-
of faith
by
which
you  will be able
all
the
darts
of the
evil one
-
flaming
to quench
And
the
helmet
-
of  salvation
take
and
the
sword
of the
spirit
which
is
(the) word
of God
by means of
all
prayer
and
petition
praying
at
every
time
in
spirit
and
to
this very thing
keeping watch
with
all
perseverance
and
petition
concerning
all
the
saints
and
for
me
that
to me
may be given
utterance
in
opening
the
mouth
of me
in
boldness
to make known
the
mystery
of the
gospel
on behalf of
which
I am an ambassador
in
chain(s)
that
in
it
I may be bold
as
it is necessary (for)
me
to speak
that
now
may know
also
you
the things
about
me
what
I am  doing
all things
will make known
to you
Tychicus
the
beloved
brother
and
faithful
minister
in
(the) Lord
whom
I sent
to
you
for
this very thing
*
that
you may know
the things
concerning
us
and
he may encourage
the
hearts
of you

to the

grace
to you
and
peace
from
God
(the)  father
of us
and
Lord
Jesus
Christ
I thank
the
God
of me
at
every
-
remembrance
of you
always
in
every
supplication
of me
on behalf of
all
you
with
joy
the
supplication
making
in view of
the
participation
of you
in
the
gospel
from
the
first
day
until
-
now
having become confident of
this very thing
*
that
the one
having begun
in
you
work
a good
will complete (it)
until
(the) day
of Christ
Jesus
even as
it is
right
for me
this
to think
on behalf of
all
you
because
-
have
me
in
the(your)
heart
you
in
both
the
bonds
of me
and
in
the
defense
and
vindication
of the
good news
partakers
of me
of the
grace
all
you
being
witness
For
of me
-
(is) God
how
I yearn for
all
you
in
(the) bowels(affections)
of Christ
Jesus
And
this
I pray
that
the
love
of you
yet
more
and
more
may increase
in
deeper knowledge
and
all
perception
for
-
to approve
you
the things
being superior
that
you may be
pure
and
blameless
in
(the) day
of Christ
having been filled (with)
(the) fruit
of righteousness
-
through
Jesus
Christ
to
(the) glory
and
praise
of God.
to know
now
you
I want
brothers
that
the things
concerning
me
even more
to
an advancement
of the
good news
have come
so that
the
bonds
of me
manifest
in
Christ
to have become
in
all
the
praetorium
and
to the
rest
all
and
-
most
of the
brothers
in
(the) Lord
having become confident
(with respect) to the
bonds
of me
(are) more readily (willing)
to dare
fearlessly
the
Word
to speak
Some
indeed
even
because of
envy
and
strife
some
but
indeed
because of
good intention
-
Christ
proclaim
(these) ones
-
out of
love
knowing
that
for
a defense
of the
good news
I am appointed
(those other) ones
but
out of
rivalry
-
Christ
preach
not
purely
supposing
trouble
to raise(stir) up
(as I am) in the
bonds
of me
what
then
only
that
in every
way
whether
in pretense
or
in truth
Christ
is preached
and
in
this
I rejoice
yet
in addition
I will rejoice
I know
For
that
this
for me
will turn out
for
(my) deliverance
through
the
of you
prayers
and
(the) bountiful supply
of the
Spirit
of Jesus
Christ
according to
the
earnest expectation
and
hope
of me
that
in
nothing
I will be put to shame
but
with
all
courage
as
always
even
now
will be magnified
Christ
in
the
body
of me
whether
through
life
or
through
death
to me
For
-
to live(living)
(is) Christ
and
-
to die(dying)
(is) gain
if (it means)
But
-
to live
in
(the) flesh
this
for me
(is) fruit
of labor
and
what
I will choose
not
I know
I am hard-pressed
now
from
-
two (sides)
the
desire
having
-
-
to depart
and
with
Christ
to be
much
for
much
better (this is)
-
but
to remain
in
the
flesh
(is) more necessary
for the sake of
you
And
this
having been persuaded of
I know
that
I will remain
and
will continue with
all
you
for
the
of you
progress
and
joy
of the
faith
that
the
boast
of you
may increase
in
Christ
Jesus
in
me
through
the
of me
presence
again
with
you
Only
worthily
of the
good news
-
of Christ
conduct (your) citizenship
that
whether
having come
and
having seen
you
or
being absent
I may hear (of)
the things
concerning
you
that
you are standing
in
one
spirit
with one
soul
contending
for the
faith
of the
good news
and
not
being frightened
in
anything
by
the ones
opposing
which
is
to them
a proof
of destruction
to you
but
of salvation
and
this
from
God
because
to  you
it was given
-
on behalf of
Christ
not
only
-
in
Him
to believe
but
also
-
on behalf of
Him
to suffer
the
same
struggle
having
which
you saw
in
me
and
now
hear (to be)
in
me
if (there is)
any
therefore
encouragement
in
Christ
if
any
consolation
of love
if
any
fellowship
of (the) spirit
if
any bowels(affection)
bowels(affection)
and
compassions
make complete
of me
the
joy
that
the
same thing
you think
the
same
love
having
(as) ones joined in  soul
the
one thing
thinking
(doing) nothing
according to
rivalry
neither
according to
empty conceit
but
-
in humility
one another
esteeming
surpassing
themselves
not
the things
of themselves
every person
looking at
but
also
(at) the things
of others
each person
this
think
in
you
which
(was) also
in
Christ
Jesus
who
in
(the) form
of God
existing
not
a thing to be grasped
did regard
-
to be
equal
with God
but
Himself
he poured out
(the) form
of a slave
taking
in
(the) likeness
of men
having been born
and
in  appearance
having been found
as
a man
He humbled
himself
having become
obedient
unto
death
a death
and (that)
of(by) a cross
wherefore
also
-
God
Him
exalted
and
gave
to Him
the
name
-
above
ever
name
that
in(at)
the
name
of Jesus
every
knee
should bend
of (blessing) in heaven
and
on earth
and
under the earth
and
every
tongue
should confess
-
(the) Lord
Jesus
Christ
to
(the) glory
of God
(the) father
therefore
beloved
of me
as
always
you obeyed
not
as
in
the
presence
of me
only
but
now
much
more
in
the
absence
of me
with
fear
and
trembling
-
your own
salvation
work out
God
for
is
the one
working
in
you
both
-
to will
and
-
to work
on behalf of
the(his)
good pleasure
All things
do
without
grumblings
and
arguments
that
you may be
blameless
and
pure
children
of God
without blemish
in (the) midst
of a generation
crooked
and
having been perverted
among
whom
you shine
as
luminaries
in
(the) world
(the) word
of life
holding (forth)
for
a boast
to me
in
(the)  day
of Christ
that
not
in
vain
I ran
nor
in
vain
labored
But
if
indeed
I am poured out (as a drink offering)
upon
the
sacrifice
and
priestly service
of the
faith
of you
I rejoice
and
rejoice together with
all
you
(in)  the
and
same (way)
also
you
rejoice
and
rejoice together with
me
I hope
But
in
(the) Lord
Jesus
Timothy
soon
to send
to you
that
I also
may be cheered up
knowing
the things
concerning
you
no one
For
I have
likeminded
who
genuinely
the things
concerning
you
will care for
-
all
For
the things
of themselves
seek
not
the things
of Jesus
Christ
the
But
proven worth
of him
you know
because
as
with a father
a child
with
me
he served
in
the
gospel
This one
-
therefore
I hope
to send
whenever
*
I see
(how) the things
concerning
me (will  go)
immediately
I have confidence
but
in
(the)  Lord
that
indeed
myself
quickly
I will come
necessary
But
I considered (it)
Epaphroditus
the
brother
and
co-worker
and
fellow-soldier
of me
of you
but
apostle
and
priestly minister
of the
need
of me
to send
to
you
since
yearning after
he was
all
you
and
(was) being homesick
because
you heard
that
he was sick
indeed
for
he was sick
coming near
to death
but
-
God
had mercy (on)
him
not
(on) him
and
only
but
also
(on) me
lest
*
sorrow
upon
sorrow
I should have
more eagerly
Therefore
I sent
him
that
having seen
him
again
you may rejoice
and I
less sorrowful
may be
receive
Therefore
him
in
(the) Lord
with
all
joy
and
-
such ones
in esteem
hold
because
on  account of
the
work
of Christ
to
death
he came near
having risked
the(his)
life
that
he might fill  up
the
of you
deficiency
-
to

(is) not
troublesome
for you

the
mutilators
we
for
are
the
circumsicion
the ones
by (the) spirit
of God
worshiping
and
boasting
in
Christ
Jesus
and
not
in
(the) flesh

I
(could be) having

more
as to circumcision
(on the)  eighth day
of
(the) race
of Israel
(the) tribe
of Benjamin
a Hebrew
of
Hebrews
according to
(the) law
a Pharisee
according to
zeal
persecuting
the
church
according to
righteousness
-
in
(the) Law
having become
blameless
But
what things
were
to me
gains
these
I  have considered
on account of
-
Christ
loss
But
more so
even
I consider
all things
loss
to be
on account of
the
excellency
of the
knowledge
of Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of me
on account of
whom
-
all things
I  suffered loss
and
I consider
(them) refuse
that
Christ
I may gain
and
be found
in
him
not
having
my own
righteousness
the one
of
(the)  law
but
the (righteousness)
through
faith
of (in) Christ
the
of
God
righteousness
(based) upon
-
faith
-
to know
him
and
the
power
of the
resurrection
of him
and
(the)
fellowship
of the
suffering
of him
being conformed
to the
death
of him
if
somehow
I may attain
to
the
resurrection
-
from
(the) dead
Not
that
already
I obtained
or
already
having been perfected
I pursue
but
if
indeed
I may lay hold of
(that) for
which
also
I was laid hold of
by
Christ
Jesus
brothers
I
myself
not
consider
to have laid hold
one thing
but
the things
-
behind
forgetting
to the things
and
before
stretching forward
according to
(the) goal
I  pursue
for
the
prize
of the
high
calling
-
of God
in
Christ
Jesus
as many as
therefore
(would be) perfect
this
let us think
and
if
anything
different
you think
even
this
-
God
to you
will reveal
nevertheless
to
what
we attained
by the
same (rule)
(we are) to follow
imitators together
of me
be
brothers
and
notice
the ones
thus
walking
as
you have
(as) an example
us
many
For
walk
(of)  whom
often
I was telling
you
now
and
also
weeping
I say
(they are) the
enimies
of the
cross
-
of Christ
of whom
the
end
(is) destruction
of whom
the
God
(is) the
belly
and
the
glory
in
the
shame
of them
the ones
-
earthly things
thinking
of us
For
the

in
(the) heavens
exists
from
where
also
a Savior
we eagerly await
(the) Lord
Jesus
Christ
who
will  transfigure
the

of us
(into) conformity
with the

of Him

became
I
a minister
according to
the
stewardship

of God
-
having been given
to me
for
you
to complete
the
word (message)
-
of God
the
mystery
-
having been hidden
from
the
ages
and
from
the
generations
now
but
was made manifest
to the
saints
of him
to whom
wanted
-
God
to make known
what (is)
the
wealth
of the
glory
the
mystery
of this
among
the
gentiles
which
is
Christ
in
you
the
hope
-
of glory
whom
we
announce
warning
every
man
and
teaching
every
man
in
all
wisdom
that
we may present
every
man
mature
in
Christ
for
which
also
I labor
striving
according to
the
working
of him
-
working
in
me
with
power
I want
For
you
to know
how great
a struggle
I have
for
you
and
the ones
in
Laodicea
and
as many as
not
have seen
the
face
of me
in
(the) flesh
that
may be encouraged
the
hearts
of them
having been united together
in
love
and
in
all
wealth
of the
full assurance
-
of understanding
(resulting) in
(the) knowledge
of the
mystery
-
of God
(namely) Christ
in
whom
are
all
the
treasures
-
of wisdom
and
knowledge
hidden
this
I say
so that
no one
you
may delude
with
persuasive speech
if
For ~
even
in the
flesh
I am absent
but
in the
spirit
with
you
I am
rejoicing
and
seeing
of you
the
order
and
the
firmness
the
in
Christ
faith
of you
As
therefore
you received
-
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
in
Him
walk
having been rooted
and
being built up
in
him
and
being firmly founded
in the
faith
as
you were taught
abounding
in
thanksgiving
beware
lest
anyone (of)
you
there be
-
being taken captive
through
-
philosophy
and
empty
deceit
according to
the
tradition
-
of men
according to
the
elementary principles
of the
world
and
not
according to
Christ
because
in
Him
dwells
all
the
fullness
of the
Godhead
bodily
and
you are
in
Him
having been made full
who
is
the
Head
of all
rule
and
authority
in
whom
also
you were circumcised
with a circumcision
not made with hands
in
the
putting off
of the
body
of the
flesh
in
the
circumcision
-
of Christ
having been buried together
with Him
in
the(his)
baptism
with
whom
also
you were raised together
through
the(your)
faith
of(in) the
working
-
of God
-
having raised
Him
from
(the) dead
And
you
dead
being
in
the
trespasses
and
the
uncircumcision
of the
flesh
of you
he made alive together
you
with
him
having forgiven
us
all
the
trespasses
having wiped out
the
against
us
handwriting
in the
ordinances
which
was
contrary
to us
and
it
he has taken
out of
the
midst (way)
(by) having nailed
it
to the
cross
having disarmed
the
rulers
and
the
authorities
he made a show (of them)
in
public
having triumphed
them
in(by)
it
(let) not
therefore
anyone
you
judge
in
eating
and
in
drinking
or
in
respect to
a feast
or
a new moon
or
sabbaths
which
is(are)
a shadow
of the
coming things
the
but
reality
-
(is) of Christ
(let) no one
you
deprive of the prize
(by)  delighting
in
humility
and
veneration
of the
angels
things which
he has seen
delving into
vainly
being puffed up
by
the
mind
of the
flesh
of him
and
not
holding
the
head
out from
whom
all
the
body
through
the
joints
and
ligaments
being fully supplied
and
being united together
grows
with the
growth
-
of God
since
you died
with
Christ
from
the
elementary principles
of the
world
why
as (though)
living
in
(the) world
you subject yourselves to ordinances
Not
touch
nor
taste
nor
handle
which things
are
all
(destined) to
deterioration
-
with use
according to
the
commandments
and
teachings
-
of men
Which things
are
an appearance
-
having
of wisdom
in
self-imposed religion
and
humility
and
severe treatment
of (the) body
not
in(of)
value
any
against
(the) indulgence
of the
flesh
If
therefore
you were raised with
-
Christ
the things
above
seek
where
-
Christ
is
in(at)
(the) right (hand)
-
of God
sitting
the things
above
think (about)
not
the things
on
the
earth

for
and
the
life
of you
has been hidden
with

Christ
in

God
when

Christ
is manifested

life
of you
then
also
you
with
Him
will be manifested
in

Therefore
the(your)

of God
on

we speak
not

himself
that

And
therefore

sends
to them

God
a powerful 
delusion

to believe
them
the
falsehood
that
may be judged
all
the ones
not

in(by)
faith

from
God
(the) Father
and
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
even as
I urged
you
to remain
in
Ephesus
(while I was) going
into
Macedonia
that
you may charge
certain ones
not
to teach differently
nor
to pay  attention
to myths
and
genealogies
endless
which
useless speculations
cause
rahter
than
a stewardship
of God
-
in
faith
the
But
end(aim)
of the
charge
is
love
out of
a pure
heart
and
conscience
a good
and
faith
without hypocricy
from which things
some
having missed the mark
turned aside
to
vain talking
wanting
to be
teachers of (the) law
not
understanding
either
what things
they say
nor
concerning
what things
they confidently affirm

that
good
(is) the

it
lawfully
uses

and

and
if
any
other things

teaching
(which) opposes

the
good news

(with) which

gratitude
I have
to the one
having enpowered
me
Christ
Jesus
the
Lord
of us
because
faithful
me
he considered
having put (me)
into
(his) service
-
previously
being
a blasphemer
and
a persecutor
and
an insolent man
but
I received mercy
because
being ignorant
I did (it)
in
unbelief
superabounded
and
the
grace
of the
Lord
of us
with
faith
and
love
-
in
Christ

Faithful
(is) the
Word
and
of all
acceptance
worthy
that
Christ
Jesus
came
into
the
world
sinners
to save

(the) foremost

I
but
because of
this
I received mercy
that
in

(the) foremost
might display

all
longsuffering
for
a model
of the ones
being about

on
Him

I commit
to you

being made previously
about

prophecies
that

warfare

some
having  put away
as to
the(ir)
faith
caused a shipwreck
of whom
are
Hymenaeus
and
Alexander
whom
I delivered

to Satan
that
they might be taught
not
to blaspheme
I urge
Therefore
first

supplications

on behalf of
all

of all
the ones

the

you may express
of the one
out of

you
having called

light
who
once
(were) not
a people

but
(are) a people

beloved
I  encourage (you)
as
aliens
and
exiles
to abstain from
-
fleshly
lusts
which
war
against
the
soul
the
conduct
of you
among
the
gentiles
having
good
that
wherein
*
they speak against
you
as
evildoers
by
the(your)
good
works
observing
they may glorify
-
God
in
(the) day
of visitation
submit
to every
human
institution
because of
the
Lord
whether
to a king
as
being in  authority
or
to governors
as
by
Him
being sent
for
vengeance
(on) evildoers
praise
but
of ones doing good
Because
so
is
the
will
-
of God
(by) doing good
to  silence
the
-
of senseless
men
ignorance
as
free
and
not
as
a cloak
having
-
of evil
the
freedom
but
as
of God
(the) slaves
all men
honor
the
brotherhood
love
-
God
fear
the

honor

household slaves
(be) submitting yourselves
in
all
fear
to the(your)
masters
not
only
to the
good ones
and
gentile
but
also
to the
harsh ones
this
For
(is) commendable
if
because of
a consciousness
of God
bears up under

pain
(while) suffering
unjustly
what
For
merit (is it)
if
sinning
and
being  beaten
you endure
But
if
doing good
and
suffering
you endure
this
(is) commendable
with(before)
God
to
this
For
you were called
because
also
Christ
suffered
on behalf of
you
to  you
leaving
a pattern
that
you should follow
in the
steps
of him
who
sin
not
commit
nor
was found
guile
in
the
mouth
of him
who
being reviled
not
retaliated
suffering
not
he threatened
handed himself over
but
to the one
judging
righteously
who
the
sins
of us
Himself
bore
in
the
body
of Him
on
the
tree
that
to the(our)
sins
having died
-
righteousness
we might live
by whose
-
wound
you were healed
you were
For
as
sleep
being led astray
but
you returned
now
to
the
Shepherd
and
Overseer
of the
souls
of you
likewise
the
wives
being submissive
to the(ir)
own
husbands
that
even
if
any men
are disobedient
to the
word(message)
through
the
the
of wives
conduct
without
(the) word
they will be gained
having observed
the
in
fear
pure
conduct
of you
(concerning) whose
let it be
not
the
outward
braiding
of hairs
and
putting on
of gold
or
wearning
of garments
adornment
but
the
hidden
of the
heart
self
in(by)
the
incorruptible(adorning)
of the
humble
and
quiet
spirit
which
is
before
-
God
of great worth
so
For
formerly
also
the
holy
women
the ones
hoping
in
God
were adorning
themselves
submitting themselves
to the(ir)
own
husbands
as
Sarah
obeyed
-
Abraham
lord
him
calling
of whom
you became
children
doing good
and
not
fearing
any
intimidation
the
Husbands
likewise
dwelling with (them)
according to
knowledge
as
with a weaker
vessel
the
female
showing (them)
honor
as
also
(being) co-heirs
of (the) grace
of live
so as

not
to be hindered
the
prayers
of you

all
(be) of one mind
sympathetic
loving (the) brothers
tenderhearted
humble-minded
not

(his) lips

not

let him turn away

from

(are open) to
(the) prayers
of them

And

But
if

(you are) blessed

But
with

whereas

you are spoken against

the ones

(it is) better
For
(for)  doing good
if
(so) wills
the
will

of God
to suffer
than
(for) doing wrong
Because
indeed
Christ
once
for
sins
suffered
a righteous man
on behalf of
unrighteous men
that
you
he might bring
-
to God
having been put to death
-
in (the) flesh
having been made alive
yet
in spirit
in(by)
which
also
to the
in
prison

having gone
he made a proclamation
to ones having disobeyed
(back)  then
when
was waiting
the

in
(the) days
of Noah
(while was) being prepared
(the) ark
in
which
a few
this(that)

were saved
through

Therefore
having suffered

For

will give
an account
to the one

For
indeed
to (the) dead
was (the) good news preached
that
they might be judged
indeed
as

as
God (does)

in so far as
you share

rejoice
that
also
in

of Him
you may rejoice
being glad
If
you are reproached
in(for)

(you are) blessed ones
because
the (spirit)

to him
wisdom
wrote
to you
as
also
in
all

(his) letter
speaking
in
them
concerning
these things
in
which
is(are)
hard to be understood
some things
which
the
ignorant
and
unstable
twist
as
also
the
other
scriptures
to
the
own
of them
destruction
You
therefore
beloved
knowing beforehand
guard yourselves
lest
*
with the
of the
lawless ones
error
having been led away
you fall from
the(your)
own
stability
grow
But
in
grace
and
knowledge
of the
Lord
of us
and
Savior
Jesus
Christ
To Him
(be) the
glory
both
now
and
to
(the) day
of (the) age
What
was
from
(the) beginning
which
we have heard
which
we have seen
with the
eyes
of us
which
we beheld
and
the
hands
of us
touched
with respect to
the
Word
-
of life
indeed
the
Life
was manifesteed
and
we have seen (it)
and
we give testimony
and
we proclaim
to you
the
Life
-
eternal
which
was
with
the
father
and
was manifested
to us
what
we have seen
and
we have heard
we proclaim
also
to you
that
also
you
fellowship
may have
with
us
indeed
-
fellowship
and
-
our
(is) with
the
Father
and
with
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
And
these things
write
we
that
the
joy
of us
may be
made full
And
is
this
the
message
which
we have heard
from
Him
and
we proclaim
to you
that
-
God
light
is
and
darkness
in
Him
not
there is
any
If
we say
that
fellowsip
we have
with
him
and
in
the
darkness
walk
we lie
and
not
are practicing
the
truth
if
in
the
light
we walk
as
He
is
in
the
light
fellowship
we have
with
one another
and
the
blood
of Jesus
the
Son
of Him
cleanse
us
from
every
sin
If
we say
that
sin
not
we have
ourselves
we deceive
and
the
truth
not
is
in
us
If
we confess
the
sins
of us
faithful
He is
and
righteous
that
He may forgive
us
the(our)
sins
and
may cleanse
us
from
all
unrighteousness
If
we say
that
not
we have sinned
a liar
we make
him
and
the
Word
of Him
not
is
in
us
Little children
of me
these things
I write
to you
so that
not
you sin
And
if
anyone
sins
an advocate
we have
with
the
father
Jesus
Christ
(the)  righteous
and
He
(the) propitiation(expiation)
is
for
the
sins
of us
not
for
-
ours
yet
only
but
also
for
whole
the
world
And
in(by)
this
we know
that
we have known
him
if
the
commands
of Him
we keep
the one
saying
-
I have known
him
and
the
commands
of Him
not
keeping
a liar
is
and
in
this one
the
truth
not
is
whoever
But
*
keeps
of Him
the
word
truly
in
this one
the
love
-
of(for) God
has been perfected
in(by)
this
we know
that
in
Him
we are
the one
claiming
in
Him
to abide
ought
as
that One
walked
also
himself
so
to walk
beloved
not
command
a new
I write
to you
but
command
an old
which
you were having
from
(the) beginning
the
command
-
old
is
the
Word
which
you heard
Again
command
a new
I write
to you
which
is
\\"\\"true\\"\\
in
Him
and
in
you
because
the
darkness
is passing away
and
the
light
-
\\"\\"true\\"\\
already
is shining
the one
claiming
in
the
light
to be
and
the
brother
of him
hating
in
the
darkness
is
until
now
the one
loving
the
brother
of him
in
the
light
abides(remains)
and
a cause of stumbling
in
him
not
is
the one
But
hating
the
brother
of him
in
the
darkness
is
and
in
the
darkness
walks
and
not
knows
where
he goes
because
the
darkness
blinded
the
eyes
of him
I write
to you
little children
because
have benn forgiven
you
the(your)
sins
because of
the
name
of him
I write
to you
fathers
because
you have known
the one
from
(the) beginning
I write
to you
young men
because
you have overcome
the
evil one
I  wrote
to you
young children
because
you have known
the
father
I wrote
to you
fathers
because
you have known
the one
from
(the) beginning
I wrote
to you
young men
because
strong
you are
and
the
Word
-
of God
in
you
abides
and
you have overcome
the
evil one
Not
love
the
world
neither
the things
in
the
world
If
anyone
loves
the
world
not
is
the
love
of(for) the
Father
in
him
Because
all
that
(is) in
the
world
the
lust
of the
flesh
and
the
lust
of the
eyes
and
the
pride (about)
the(this)
life's possessions
not
is
of
the
father
but
of
the
world
is
And
the
world
is passing away
and
the
lust
of it
the one
but
doing
the
will
-
of God
remains
into
the
age
children
(the) last
hour
it is
and
as
you heard
that
an antiChrist
is coming
even
now
antiChrists
many
have come
from which
we know
that
(the) last
hour
it is
from(among)
us
they departed
but
not
they were
of
us
if
for
of
us
they were
they would  have remained
*
with
us
but
that
it may be manifested
that
not
are
all (of them)
of
us
And
you
an anointing
have
from
the
Holy One,
and
you know
all things.
Not
I wrote
to you
because
not
you know
the
truth
but
because
you know
it
and
that
every
lie
of
the
truth
not
is
Who
is
the
liar
except
*
the one
denying
that
Jesus
-
is
the
Christ
the one
is
the
antiChrist
the one
denying
the
Father
and
the
son
Everyone
the one
denying
the
Son
neither
the
Father
has
the one
confessing
the
Son
and
the
Father
has
you
what
heard
from
(the) beginning
in
you
let it remain
If
in
you
remains(abides)
what
from
(the) beginning
you heard
also
you
in
the
Son
and
in
the
Father
will remain(abide)
And
this
is
the
promise
which
He
promised
us
the
life
-
eternal
these things
I wrote
to you
concerning
the ones
deceiving
you
And
you
the
anointing
which
received
from
Him
remains
in
you
and
no
need
you have
that
anyone
should teach
you
but
as
the
some
anointing
teaches
you
concerning
everything
and
\\"\\"true\\"\\
is
and
not
is
a lie
and
as
He taught
you
remain(abide)
in
him
And
now
little children
remain(abide)
in
him
that
if(when)
he is manifested
we may  have
confidence
and
not
be ashamed
from(before)
Him
at
the
coming
of him
If
you know
that
righteous
he is
you know
that
also
everyone
-
doing
-
righteousness
of
Him
has been born
See
what sort
of love
has given
to us
the
father
that
children
of God
we should be called
and
we are
Therefore
*
the
world
not
knows
us
because
not
it knew
him
beloved
now
children
of God
we are
and
not yet
it was manifested
what
we will be
we know
that
if(when)
he is manifested
like
Him
we will be
because
we will see
Him
as
is
And
everyone
-
having
-
hope
this
on(in)
him
purifies
himself
even as
that One
pure
is
Everyone
-
practicing
-
sin
also
-
lawlessness
does
and
-
sin
is
-
lawlessness
And
you know
that
that one
was manifested
that
the
sins
he might take away
and
sin
in
Him
no
is
Everyone
-
in
Him
abiding
not
is sinning
everyone
-
sinning
not
has seen
him
neither
has know
him
little children
no one
let deceive
you
the one
practicing
-
righteousness
righteous
is
even as
that one
righteous
is
the one
practicing
-
sin
of
the
devil
is
because
from
(the) beginning
the
devil
sins
For
this (cause)
was manifested
the
Son
-
of God
that
he might destroy
the
works
of the
devil
Everyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
sin
not
is practicing
because
(the) seed
of Him
in
him
abides
and
not
he is able
to sin
because
of
-
God
he has been born
in(by)
this
manifested
is(are)
the
children
-
of God
and
the
children
of the
devil
everyone
-
not
practicing
righteousness
not
is
of
-
God
also
the one
not
loving
the
brother
of him
Because
this
is
the
message
which
we heard
from
(the) beginning
that
we love
one another
not
as
Cain
of
the
evil one
(who) was
and
slaughtered
the
brother
of him
And
cause
(for)  what
he slaughtered
him
Because
the
works
of him
evil
were
the ones
and
of the
brother
of him
righteous
And
not
marvel
brothers
if
hates
you
the
world
We
know
that
we have passed
out of
-
death
into
-
life
because
we love
the
brothers
the one
not
loving
remains
in
-
death
Everyone
-
hating
the
brother
of him
a murderer
is
and
you know
that
every
murderer
not
has
life
eternal
in
him
abiding
in(by)
this
we have known
-
love
because
that one
on behalf of
us
the
life
of Him
laid down
and
we
ought
on behalf of
the
brothers
the(our)
lives
to lay down
Whoever
now
*
has
the(this)
life's possessions
of  the
world
and
sees
the
brother
of him
need
having
and
closes
the
inner affections
of him
from
him
how
the
love
-
of God
abides
in
him
Little children
not
let us love
in word
or
-
in tongue
but
in
deed
and
in reality
And
in(by)
this
we will know
that
of
the
truth
we are
and
before
Him
we will persuade
the
heart
of us
that
if
condemns (us)
of us
the
heart
because
greater
is
-
God
(than) the
heart
of us
and
he knows
all things
beloved
if
the
heart
of us
not
condemns (us)
confidence
we have
with
-
God
and
whatever
*
we ask
we receive
from
him
because
the
commands
of Him
we keep
and
the things
pleasing
before
Him
we practice
adn
this
is
the
command
of him
that
we believe
in the
name
of the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
and
we love
one another
as
He gave
command
to us
and
the one
keeping
the
commands
of Him
in
Him
abides
and
He
in
him
And
in(by)
this
we know
that
He abides
in
us
by
the
Spirit
whom
to us
he gave
Beloved
not
every
spirit
believe
but
test
the
spirits
if
of
-
God
they are
because
many
false prophets
having gone out
into
the
world
in(by)
this
we know
the
Spirit
-
of God
every
spirit
which
confesses
Jesus
Christ
in
(the)  flesh
having come
of
-
God
is
and
every
spirit
which
not
confesses
-
Jesus
of
-
God
not
is
and
this
is
the (spirit)
of the
antiChrist
which
you have heard
that
he(it) comes
and
now
in
the
world
is
already
You
of
-
God
are
little children
and
you have overcome
them
because
greater
is
the one
in
you
than
the one
in
the
world
They
of
the
world
are
therefore
*
of
the
world
they speak
and
the
world
them
hears
We
of
-
God
are
the one
knowing
-
God
hears
us
(he) who
not
is
of
-
God
not
hears
us
From
this
we know
the
spirit
-
of truth
and
the
spirit
-
of  error
beloved
let us love
one another
because
-
love
of
-
God
is
and
everyone
-
loving
of
-
God
has been born
and
knows
-
God
the  one
not
loving
not
knew
-
God
because
-
God
love
is
in(by)
this
was manifested
the
love
-
of God
among
us
because
the
Son
of Him
-
only
has sent
-
God
into
the
world
that
we may live
through
him
In
this
is
-
love
not
that
we
have loved
-
God
but
that
He
loved
us
and
gave
the
son
of Him
(as) a propitiation(expiation)
for
the
sins
of us
beloved
if
so
-
God
loved
us
also
we
ought
one another
to love
God
No one
ever
has beheld
if
we love
one another
-
God
in
us
abides
and
the
love
of(for) him
in
us
perfected
has been
in(by)
this
we know
that
in
Him
we abide
and
He
in
us
because
of
the
Spirit
of Him
He has given
us
And
we
have beheld
and
we testify
that
the
Father
has sent
the
Son
(as) Savior
of the
world
Whoever
*
confesses
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
-
of God
-
God
in
him
abides
and
he
in
-
God
And
we
have known
and
have believed
the
love
which
has
-
God
as to
us
-
God
love
is
and
the  one
abiding
in
the(this)
love
in
-
God
abides
and
-
God
in
him
abides
in(by)
this
has been perfected
the
love
with
us
that
confidence
we may have
in
the
day
-
of judgment
because
as
that one
is
also
we
are
in
-
world
this
Fear
not
is
in
the(this)
love
but
the
perfect
love
out
casts
the
fear
because
-
fear
punishment
has (to do with)
the one
and
fearing
not
has been perfected
in
-
love
We
love
because
He
first
loved
us
If
anyone
says
-
I love
-
God
and
the
brother
of him
hates
a liar
he is
the one
for
not
loving
the
brother
of him
whom
he has seen
-
God
whom
not
he has seen
not
he is able
to love
And
this
-
command
we have
from
him
that
the one
loving
-
God
should love
also
the
brother
of him
Everyone
-
believing
that
Jesus
is
the
Christ
of
-
God
has been born
and
everyone
-
loving
the one
having given birth
loves
also
the one
having been born
of
him
in(by)
this
we know
that
we love
the
children
-
of god
when
-
God
we love
and
the
commands
of Him
we do
this
For
is
the
love
-
of(for) God
that
the
commands
of Him
we keep
and
the
commands
of Him
burdensome
not
are
Because
all
that
has been born
of
-
God
overcomes
the
world
and
this
is
the
victory
the one
having overcome
the
world
the
faith
of us
Who
and
is
the one
overcoming
the
world
except
*
the one
believing
that
Jesus
is
the
Son
-
of God
this one
is
the one
having come
by
water
and
blood
Jesus
Christ
not
in(by)
the
water
only
but
in(by)
the
water
and
in(by)
the
blood
And
the
Spirit
is
the one
gving testimony
because
the
Spirit
is
the
truth
Because
three
there are
-
giving tesimony
The
Spirit
and
the
water
and
the
blood
and
the
three
for
the
one (testimony)
are
If
the
witness
-
of men
we receive
the
testimony
-
of God
greater
is
because
this
is
the
testimony
-
of God
that
he has testified
concerning
the
Son
of him
the one
believing
in
the
Son
-
of God
has
the
witness
in
himself
the one
not
believing
-
God
a liar
has made
him
because
not
he has believed
in
the
testimony
which
has testified
-
God
concerning
the
Son
of him
And
this
is
the
testimony
that
life
eternal
gave
to us
-
God
and
this
-
life
in
the
Son
of Him
is
the one
having
the
Son
has
the(this)
life
the one
not
having
the
Son
-
of God
the
life
not
has
These things
I wrote
to you
that
you make known
that
life
you have
eternal
to the ones
believing
in
the
name
of the
Son
-
of God
And
this
is
the
confidence
which
we have
towards
him
that
if
anything
we ask
according to
the
will
of him
He hears
us
and
if
we know
that
He hears
us
whatever
*
we ask
we know
that
we have
the
requests
which
we have asked
from
him
If
anyone
sees
the
broher
of him
sinning
a sin
not
(leading) to
death
he will ask
and
He will give
to him
life
to the ones
sinning
not
(leading) to
death
There is
a sin
(leading)  to
death
not
concerning
that (sin)
do I say
that
you should ask
every
unrighteousness
sin
is
and
there is
sin
not
(leading) to
death
We know
that
everyone
-
having been born
of
-
God
not
continually sins
but
the one
having benn born
of
-
God
keeps
him
and
the
evil one
not
touches
him
We know
that
of
-
God
we are
and
the
world
whole
in
the
evil one
lies
we know
And
that
the
Son
-
of God
has come
and
has given
us
understanding
that
we may know
the
true one
and
we are
in
the
true one
(even) in
the
Son
of Him
Jesus
Christ
this one
is
the
\\"\\"true\\"\\
God
and
life
eternal
little children
keep
yourselves
from
-
idols
The
elder
to (the) chosen
lady
and
to the
children
of her
whom
I
love
in
(the) truth
and
not
I
only
but
also
all
the ones
having known
the
truth
because of
the
truth
-
abiding
in
us
and
with
us
it will be
into
the
age
will be
with
us
grce
mercy
peace
from
God
(the) father
and
from
Jesus
Christ
the
Son
of the
father
in
truth
and
love
I rejoiced
exceedingly
that
I have found
(some) of
the
children
of you
walking
in
(the) truth
as
a command (to do so)
we received
from
the
father
And
now
I ask
you
lady
not
as
command
writing
to you
a new
but
(that) which
we had
from
(the) beginning
that
we should love
one another
And
this
is
-
love
that
we should walk
according to
the
commands
of him
This
the
command
is
as
we heard
from
(the) beginning
that
in
it
we sould walk
Because
many
deceivers
went out
into
the
world
the ones
not
confessing
Jesus
Christ
(as) coming
in
(the) flesh
this son
is
the
deceiver
and
the
antiChrist
watch (out)
(for) yourselveslest
lest
*
you lose
what
we worked (for)
but
reward
a full
you may receive
Everyone
the
going ahead (before)
and
not
remaining
in
the
teaching
-
of Christ
God
not
has
the one
remaining
in
the
teaching
this one
both
the
Father

I
John,
the
brother
of you
and
co-sharer
in
the
affliction
and

and
patience
in
of Jesus
came to be
in
the
island
-
being called
Patmos,
for
the
Word
-
of God
and
of the
witness
of (for) Jesus.
I  came to be
in
(the) Spirit
in
the
Lord's
day;
and
I heard
behind
me
a voice
great
as
a trumpet,
saying,
What
you see
write
into
a scroll,
and
send
to the
seven
churches
to
Ephesus,
and
to
Smyrna,
and
to
Pergamos,
and

and
to
Sardis,
and
to
Philadelphia,
and
to
Laodicea.
And
I turned
to see
the
voice
which
spoke
with
me.
And
having turned
I saw
seven
lampstands
of gold,
and
in
(the) midst
of the
lampstands
(One) like
the (Son)
of man,
having been clothed
to (the) feet,
and
having been girded
with at
the
breasts
a girdle
of gold.
the
And
head
of Him
and
the
hairs
white
as
wool
white,
as
snow;
and
the
eyes
of Him
as
a flame
of fire;
And
the
feet
of Him
like
burnished brass,
as
in
a furnace
having been fired;
and
the
voice
of Him
as
a sound
of waters
many,
and
having
in
the
right
hand
of Him
stars
seven;
and
out of
the
mouth
of Him
a sword
two-mouthed
sharp
proceeding,
and
the
face
of Him,
as
the
sun
shines
in
the
power
of it.
And
when
I saw
Him,
I fell
at
the
feet
of Him
as
dead;
and
He placed
the
right (hand)
of Him
on
me,
saying,
Not
do fear;
I
am
the
First
and
the
Last,
and
the
Living One
and
I became
dead,
and
behold,
living
I am
to
the
ages

ages.
And
I have
the
keys
-
of death
and
-
of Hades.
Write
therefore
the things
you saw
and
things
which are,
and
things
that are
about to be
after
these things;

mystery

the

I have
against
you,
that

you left.
Remember
therefore
from where
you have falled,
and
repent,
and
the
first
works
you do;
if
and
not,
I am coming
to you
and
will move
the
lampstand
of you
from
the
place
of it,
if
not
you repent.
But
this
you have,
that
you hate
the
works

Nicolaitans,
which
also
I hate.

I have
against
you
a few things,
for
you have
there
those holding
the
teaching
of Balaam,
who
taught
-
Balak
to throw
a snare
before
the
sons
of Israel
to eat
idol sacrifices
and
to do fornication.
So
have
also
you
those holding

Nicolaitans;
likewise.
Repent!

miserable
and
poor
and
blind
and
naked;
I counsel
you
to buy
from
Me
gold
having been fired
by
fire,
that
you may be rich,
and
garments
white,
that
you be clothed,
and
not
may be revealed
the
shame
of the
nakedness
of you;
and
with eyesalve
anoint
the
eyes
of you,
that
you may see.
I
as many as
I
love,
I rebuke
and
I chasten;
be zealous
then
and
repent.
Behold!
I stand
at
the
door
and
knock;
If
anyone
hears
the
voice
of Me,
and
opens
the
door,
indeed
I will come in
to
him.
And
I will dine
with
him,
and
he
with
Me.
The (one)
overcoming
I will give
him
to sit
with
Me
in
the
throne
of Me,
as
I also
overcame
and
sat
with
the
Father
of Me
in
the
throne
of Him.
The (one)
having
an ear
hear
what
the
Spirit
says
to the
churches.
After
these things
I saw,
and
behold,
a door
having been opened
in
-
Heaven,
and
the
voice
-
first
which
I heard
as
a trumpet
speaking
with
Me,
saying,
Come up
here,
and
I will show
you
what
must
happen
after
these things.
At once
I became
in
spirit;
And
behold!
A throne
was set
in
-
Heaven,
and
on
the
throne
(One) sitting,
And
the (one)
sitting
like
in appearance
a stone
jasper
and
a sardius;
and
a rainbow
(was) around
the
throne
like
in appearance
to an emerald.
And
around
the
throne
(were) thrones
twenty
four;
and
on
the
throne
twenty
four
elders
sitting
having been clothed
in
garments
white,
and
on
the
heads
of them
crowns
of gold.
And
out of
the
throne
came forth
lightnings
and
voices
and
thunders.
And
seven
lamps
of fire
(are) burning
before
the
throne,
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
-
of God;
And
before
the
throne
as (if there were)
sea
a glassy,
like
to crystal.
And
in (the)
midst of
of the
throne
and
around
the
throne
four
living creatures
full
of eyes
before
and
behind;
and
the
living creatures
-
first
like
a lion,
and
the
second
living creature
like
a calf,
and
the
third
living creature
having
a
face
as
of a man,
and
the
fourth
living creature
like
an eagle
flying.
And
the
four
living creatures
one
by
one
of them
having
each
wings
six
all around,
and
within
being full
of eyes,
and
respite
not
they have
day
and
night,
saying,
Holy
holy
holy
Lord
-
God
the
Almighty,
the (One)
(who) was
and
-
is
and
the
coming (One).
And
when
shall give
the
living creature
glory
and
honor
and
thanks
to Him
sitting
on
the
throne
to the (One)
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages,
will fall down
the
twenty
four
elders
before
the (One)
sitting
on
the
throne,
and
they will worship
Him
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages
and
will cast
the
crowns
of them
before
the
throne,
saying,
Worthy
are you,
the
Lord
and
the
God
of us,
to receive
the
glory
and
the
honor
and
the
power,
because
you
created
-
all things,
and
because of
the
will
of you
they are
and
were created.
And
I saw
on
the
right
of the (One)
sitting
on
the
throne
a scroll
having been written
within
and
on the back,
having been sealed
with seals
seven.
And
I saw
an angel
strong
proclaiming
with
a voice
great,
Who
worthy
to open
the
scroll
and
to loosen
the
seals
of it?
And
no one
was able
in
-
Heaven
nor
on
the
earth,
nor
underneath
the
earth
to open
the
scroll
nor
to see
it.
And
I wept
much,
because
no one
worthy
was found
to open
the
scroll
nor
to see
it.
And
one
of
the
elders
said
to me,
Not
do weep,
behold,
overcame
the
Lion
being
of
the
tribe
of Judah,
the
root
of David,
to open
the
scroll
and
the
seven
seals
of it.
And
I saw
in
(the) midst of
the
throne
and
of the
four
living creatures,
and
in
amidst
the
elders,
a Lamb
standing
as
having been slain,
having
horns
seven
and
eyes
seven,
which
are
the
seven
Spirits
-
of God
having been sent out
into
all
the
earth.
And
He came,
and
took
out of
the
right (hand)
of the
(One) sitting
on
the
throne.
And
when
He took
the
scroll,
the
four
living creatures
and
the
twenty
four
elders
fell down
before
the
Lamb,
having
each one
harps,
and
bowls
of gold
full
of incenses,
which
are
the
prayers
of the
saints.
And
they sing
a song
new,
saying,
Worthy
are You
to receive
the
scroll,
and
to open
the
seals
of it;
because
You were slain
and
purchased
the
to God
by
the
blood
of You
out of
every
tribe
and
tongue
and
people
and
nation,
and
made
us
to the
God
of us
kings
and
priests,
and
we shall reign
over
the
earth.
And
I saw,
and
I heard
a sound
of angels
many
around
the
throne
and
the
living creatures
and
of the
elders;
and
was
the
number
of them
myriads
of myriads,
and
thousands
of thousands
saying
with a voice
great,
Worthy
is
the
Lamb
-
having been slain
to receive
the
power
and
riches
and
wisdom
and
strength
and
honor
and
glory
and
blessing.
And
every
creature
which
in
-
Heaven
and
on
the
earth,
and
underneath
the
earth,
and
on
the
sea
and
-
in
them
all things
I heard
saying
to the (One)
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to the
Lamb
the
blessing
and
the
honor
and
the
glory
and
the
might
to
the
ages
of the
ages.
And
the
four
living creatures
said,
Amen.
And
the
elders
fell down
and
worshiped.
And
I saw
when
opened
the
Lamb
one
of
the
seven
seals,
and
I heard
one
of
the
four
living creatures
saying,
as
a sound
of thunder,
Come.
And
I saw,
and
behold!
a horse
white,
and
the (one)
sitting
on
it
having
a bow;
and
was given
to it
a crown,
and
he went out
overcoming
and
that he might
overcome.
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
second,
I heard
the
second
living creature
saying,
Come.
And
went out
another
hourse
red;
and
the (one)
sitting
on
it
was given
to him
to take
the
peace
from
the
earth,
and
that
one another
they shall slay;
and
was given
to him
a sword
large.
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
third,
I heard
the
third
living creature
saying,
Come.
And
I saw,
and
behold!
horse
A black,
and
the (one)
sitting
on
it
having
a balance
in
the
hand
of him.
And
I heard
as (it were)
a voice
in
(the) midst
of the
four
living creatures
saying,
A choenix
of wheat
(for) a denarius,
and
three
choenixes
of barley
(for) a denarius;
and
the
oil
and
the
wine
not
harm.
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
fourth,
I heard
(the) voice
of the
fourth
living creature
saying,
Come.
And
I saw,
and
behold,
horse
a pale green,
and
the (one)
sitting
on
it,
(the) name
to it
(was)
death,
and
-
Hades
followed
with
him;
and
was given
to them
authority
over
the
fourth
of the
earth
to kill
with
sword
and
with
famine,
and
with
death,
and
by
the
wild beasts
of the
earth.
And
when
He opened
the
fifth
seal,
I saw
underneath
the
altar
the
souls
of those
having been slain
for
the
Word
-
of God,
and
for
the
witness
which
they had,
and
they cried
with a voice
great.
saying,
Until
when,
-
Master,
-
holy
and
true,
not
do You judge
and
avenge
the
blood
of us
from
those
living
on
the
earth?
And
was given
to them
each one
a robe
white,
and
it was said
to them
that
they should rest
yet
time
a little,
until
should be fulfilled
also
the
fellow-slaves
of them
and
the
brothers
of them,
those
being about
to be killed
as
also
they.
And
I saw
when
He opened
the
seal
-
sixth,
and
An earthquake
great
occurred,
and
the
sun
became
black
as
sackcloth
made of hair,
and
the
moon
whole
became
as
blood,
and
the
stars
of the
heaven
fell
to
the
earth,
as
a fig-tree
casts
the
unripe figs
of it,
by
wind
a great
being shaken,
and
the
heaven
departed
as
a scroll
being rolled up,
and
every
mountain
and
island
from
the
places
of them
were moved.
And
the
kings
of the
earth
and
the
great ones,
and
the
chiliarchs,
and
the
rich,
and
the
powerful,
and
every
slave,
and
freeman,
hid
themselves
in
the
caves
and
in
the
rocks
of the
mountains,
and
they say
to the
mountains
and
to the
rocks,
Fall
on
us,
and
hide
us
from
(the) face
of the (One)
sitting
on
the
throne,
even
from
the
wrath
of the
Lamb;
because
came
the
day
-
great
of the
wrath
of Him,
and
who
is able
to stand?
After
this
I saw
four
angels
standing
on
the
four
corners
of the
earth,
holding
the
four
winds
of the
earth,
that
not should
blow
wind
on
the
earth,
nor
on
the
sea,
nor
on
every
tree.
And
I saw
another
angel
coming up
from
(the) rising
of (the) Sun,
having
a seal
of God
(the) living;
and
he cried
(with) voice
a great
to the
four
angels,
to whom
it was given
to them
to harm
the
earth
and
the
sea,
saying,
Not
do harm
the
earth
nor
the
sea,
nor
the
trees,
until
we may seal
the
slaves
of the
God
of us
on
the
foreheads
of them.
And
I heard
the
number
of the (ones)
having been sealed,
A hundred
forty
four
thousands.
having been sealed
out of
every
tribe
of (the) sons
of Israel;
Of
(the) tribe
of Judah,
twelve
thousands
having been sealed;
Of
(the) tribe
of Reuben
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Gad
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Asher
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Naphtali
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Manasseh
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Simeon
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Levi
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Issachar
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Zebulun
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Joseph
twelve
thousands;
of
(the) tribe
of Benjamin
twelve
thousands;
having been sealed.
After
these things
I saw,
and
behold!
crowd
A huge,
which
to number
them
no one
was able
out of
every
nation
and
tribes
and
peoples
and
tongues,
standing
before
the
throne
and
before
the
Lamb,
having been clothed (with)
robes
white,
and
palms
in
the
hands
of them;
and
they cry
(with) voice
a great,
saying,
-
Salvation
to the
God
of us
the one
sitting
on
the
throne
and
to the
Lamb.
And
all
the
angels
stood
around
the
throne
and
the
elders
and
of the
four
living creatures
and
they fell
before
the
throne
on
(the)
faces
of them,
and
worshiped
-
God,
saying,
Amen;
-
blessing
and
-
glory
and
-
wisdom
and
-
thanksgiving
and
-
honor
and
-
power
and
-
strength
to the
God
of us
to
the
ages
of the
ages.
Amen.
And
answered
one
of
the
elders,
saying
to me,
These
the (ones)
having been clothed
(in)
robes
the
white,
who
are they,
and
whence
came they?
And
I said
to him,
Sir,
of me,
you
know.
And
he said
to me,
These
are
the (ones)
coming out
of
the
affliction
-
great,
and
they washed
the
robes
of them,
and
whitened
them
in
the
blood
of the
Lamb.
Because
of this
they are
before
the
throne
-
of God,
and
serve
Him
day
and
night
in
the
temple
of Him;
and
the (one)
sitting
on
the
throne
tabernacled
over
them.
not
they will hunger
longer,
nor
will they thirst
longer,
nor
not
shall fall
on
them
the
sun,
nor
every (kind of)
heat;
because
the
Lamb
the
in 
midst
of the
throne
will shepherd
them,
and
will lead
them
on
living
fountains
of waters,
and
will wipe off
-
God
every
tear
from
the
eyes
of them.
And
when
He opened
the
seal
-
seventh,
occurred
a silence
in
-
Heaven
about
a half hour.
And
I saw
the
seven
angels
who
before
-
God
stood
and
were given
to them
seven
trumpets.
And
another
angel
came,
and
stood
at
the
altar,
having
a censer
of Gold;
and
was given
to him
incenses
many,
that
he give
with the
prayers
of the
souls
all
at
the
altar
-
of gold
-
before
the
throne.
And
went up
the
smoke
of the
incenses
with the
prayers
of the
saints
out of
(the) hand
of the
angel
before
-
God.
And
has taken
the
angel
the
censer,
and
filled
it
from
the
fire
of the
altar,
and
cast (it)
into
the
earth;
and
occurred
thunders
and
sounds
and
lightnings
and
an earthquake.
And
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
that
they might trumpet.
And
the
first
trumpeted
and
occurred
hail
and
fire
being mixed
with
blood,
and
it was cast
onto
the
earth;
and
the
third (part)
of the
earth
was burnt up,
and
the
third (part)
of the
trees
was burnt up,
and
all
grass
green
was burned.
And
the
second
angel
trumpeted,
and
as a
mountain
great
with fire
burning
was cast
into
the
sea;
and
became
the
third (part)
of the
sea
blood;
and
died
the
third (part)
of the
creatures
-
in
the
sea,
the (ones)
having
souls,
and
the
third (part)
of the
ships
were destroyed.
And
the
third
angel
trumpeted,
and
fell out
of
the
heaven
a star
great
burning
like
a lamp,
and
it fell
onto
the
third (part)
of the
rivers,
and
onto
the
fountains
of
waters.
And
the
name
of the
star
is said (to be)
-
Wormwood;
and
became
the
third (part)
of the
waters
into
wormwood,
and
many
of
men
died
from
the
waters,
because
they were bitter.
And
the
fourth
angel
trumpeted,
and
was struck
the
third
of the
Sun
and
the
third (part)
of the
moon
and
the
third (part)
of the
stars,
that
might be darkened
the
third
of them,
and
the
day
not
appear
the
third (part)
of it,
and
the
night
likewise.
And
I saw,
and
I heard
one
eagle
flying
in
midheaven,
saying,
with a voice
great,
Woe!
Woe!
Woe
to those
dwelling
on
the
earth,
from
the
rest
of (the) voices
of the
trumpet
of the
three
angels
-
being about
to trumpet!
And
the
fifth
angel
trumpeted,
and
I saw
a star
out of
the
heaven
having fallen
onto
the
earth,
and
was given
to it
the
key
to the
pit
of the
abyss.
And
he opened
the
pit
of the
abyss,
and
went up
a smoke
out of
the
pit
as
smoke
of a furnace
great,
and
was darkened
the
sun
and
the
air
from
the
smoke
of the
pit.
And
out of
the
smoke
came forth
locusts
to
the
earth,
and
was given
to them
authority,
as
have
authority
the
scorpions
of the
earth.
And
it was said
to them
that
not
they would harm
the
grass
of the
earth,
nor
every
green thing,
nor
every
tree,
except
-
the
men
who
not
have
the
seal
-
of God
on
the
foreheads.
And
was given
to them
that
not
they should kill
them,
but
that
they be tormented
months
five;
and
the
torment
of them
(is) as
(the) torment
of a scorpion
when
it stings
a man.
And
in
-
days
those
will seek
-
men
-
death,
and
not
-
they will find
it;
and
they will long
to die,
and
will flee
-
death
from
them.
And
the
likeness
of the
locusts
like
horses
having been prepared
for
war,
and
on
the
heads
of them
as
crowns
like
gold,
and
the
faces
of them
as
the faces
of men,
and
they had
hairs
as
hairs
of a woman,
and
the
teeth
of them
as
of lions
were,
and
they had
breastplates
as
breastplates
iron,
and
the
sound
of the
wings
of them
as
(the) sound
chariots
of horses
many
running
to
war.
And
they have
tails
like
scorpions,
and
stings
and
in
the
tails
of them
the
authority
of them
(is) to harm
-
men
months
five.
And
over
them
a king,
the
angel
of the
abyss;
name
to him
in Hebrew
Abaddon,
and
in
the
Greek
(the) name
he has (is)
Apollyon.
The
woe
-
one
has departed;
behold,
comes
yet
two
woes
after
these things.
And
the
sixth
angel
trumpeted,
and
I heard
a voice
one
from
the
four
horns
of the
altar
-
of gold
-
before
-
God
saying
to the
sixth
angel
the one
had
the
trumpet,
Loose
the
four
angels
the (ones)
having been bound
at
the
river
-
great
Euphrates.
And
were loosed
the
four
angels
the (ones)
having been prepared
for
the
hour
and
day
and
month
and
year,
that
they should kill
the
third (part)
-
of men.
And
the
number
-
of the armies
of the
calvary
two myriads
of myriads;
I heard
the
number
of them.
And
so
I saw
the
horses
in
the
vision,
and
those
sitting
on
them
having
breastplates
fire-colored
and
dusky red
and
brimstone-like;
and
the
heads
of the
horses
as
heads
of lions,
and
out of
the
mouths
of them
comes out
fire
and
smoke
and
brimstone.
By
-
three
plagues
these
were killed
the
third (part)
-
of men
from
the
fire
and
the
smoke
and
the
brimstone
-
coming out
from
the
mouths
of them.
the
For
authority
of the
horses
in
the
mouth
of them
is
and
in
the
tails
of them;
the
for
tails
of them
(are) like
snakes,
having

and
with
them
they do harm.
And
the
rest
-
men,
who
not
were killed
by
-
plagues
these,
not
repented
of
the
works
of the
hands
of them,
that
not
they will worship
-
demons,
and
the
idols
-
golden
and
-
silver
and
-
bronze
and
-
stone
and
-
wood,
which
neither
see
are able,
nor
to hear,
nor
to walk,
and
not
they repented
of
the
murders
of them,
nor
of
the
sorceries
of them,
nor
of
the
fornications
of them,
nor
of
the
thefts
of them.
And
I saw
another
angel
strong
coming down
out of
the
heaven,
having been clothed
(with) a cloud,
and
a
rainbow
on
the
head
of him,
and
the
face
of him
as
the
sun,
and
the
feet
of him
as
pillars
of fire.
and
he had
in
the
hand
of him
a little scroll
having been opened;
and
he placed
the
foot
of him
the
right
on
the
sea,
the
and
left
on
the
land,
and
cried with
a voice
great
as
a lion
roars.
And
when
he cried out,
spoke
the
seven
thunders
the
of themselves
voices.
And
when
spoke
the
seven
thunders
I was going
to write;
and
I heard
a voice
out
of
Heaven,
saying,
Seal
what things
spoke
the
seven
thunders,
and
not
them
write.
And
the
angel
whom
I saw
standing
on
the
sea
and
on
the
land
lifted
the
hand
of him
-
right
toward
-
Heaven,
and
swore
by
the (One)
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages,
who
created
the
heaven
and
the things
in
it,
and
the
earth
and
the things
in
it,
and
the
sea
and
the things
in
it,
that
time
not
shall be longer,
but
in
the
days
of the
voice
of the
seventh
angel,
whenever
he is about
to trumpet,
and
may be ended
the
mystery
-
of God,
as
He proclaimed
to the
of Himself
slaves
the
prophets.
And
the
voice
which
I heard
out of
-
Heaven,
again
spoke
with
me,
and
saying,
Go,
take
the
little scroll
-
having been opened
in
the
hand
of the
angle
-
standing
on
the
sea
and
on
the
land.
And
I went away
to
the
angel,
saying
to him,
Give
me
the
little scroll.
And
he said
to me,
Take
and
eat up
it;
and it will
embitter
of you
the
belly,
but
in
the
mouth
of you
it will be
sweet
as
honey.
And
I took
the
little scroll
out of
the
hand
of the
angel,
and
ate
it,
and
it was
in
the
mouth
of me
as
honey,
sweet;
and
when
I ate
it,
was made bitter
the
belly
of me.
And
he says
to me,
must
You
again

as to
peoples
and
nations
and
tongues
and
kings
many.
And
was given
to me
a reed
like
a staff,
saying,
Rise,
and
measure
the
temple
-
of God
and
the
altar
and
those
worshiping
in
it.
And
the
court
-
outside
of the
temple
cast
outside,
and
not
it

because
it was given
to the
nations;
and
the
city
-
holy
they will trample
months
forty
and
two.
And
I will give
to the
two
witnesses
of Me,
and
they will prophesy
days
a thousand
two-hundred
sixty
having been clothed
(in) sackcloth.
These
are
the
two
olive-trees,
and
the
two
lampstands
-
before
-
God
of the
earth
standing.
And
if
anyone
them
desires
to harm,
fire
will come out
from
the
mouths
of them,
and
consumes
the
enemies
of them;
and
if
anyone
desires
them
to harm,
so
ought
him
to be killed.
These
have
the
authority
to shut
the
heaven,
that
not
rain
may rain
-
days
of the
prophesy
of them,
and
authority
they have
over
the
waters,
to turn
them
into
blood,
and
to strike
the
earth
with
every
plague,
as often
as if
they desire.
And
when
they finish
the
witness
of them,
the
beast
-
coming up
out of
the
abyss
will make
with
them,
war
and
will overcome
them,
and
will kill
them.
And
the
bodies
of them
on
the
street
of
city
the
of great,
which
is called
spiritually
Sodom
and
Egypt,
where
indeed
the
Lord
of us
was crucified.
And
will see
(some) of
the
peoples
and
tribes
and
tongues
and
nations
the
bodies
of them
days
three
and
a half,
and
the
bodies
of them
not
they allow
to be placed
into
tombs.
And
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
will rejoice
over
them,
and
will make merry,
and
gifts
they will send
one another,
because
these
-
two
prophets
tormented
the (ones)
dwelling
on
the
earth.
And
after
-
three
days
and
a half
a spirit
of life
from
-
God
entered
in(to)
them,
and
they stood
on
the
feet
of them,
and
fear
great
fell
on
the (ones)
beholding
them.
And
they heard
a voice
great
from
-
Heaven,
saying
to them,
Come up
here.
And
they went up
into
the
Heaven
in
the
cloud;
and
beheld
them
the
enemies
of them.
And
in
that
-
hour
occurred
earthquake

and
the
tenth (part)
of the

in
the
earthquake

of men,
thousands

and
the
rest
terrified
became,
and
gave
glory
to the
God
-
of Heaven.
The
woe
-
second
passed away.
Behold!
The
woe
-
third
is coming
quickly.
And
the
seventh
angel
trumpeted,
and
there were
voices
great
in
-
Heaven,
saying,
became
the
kingdoms
of the
world,
of the
Lord
of us,
and
the
Christ
of Him,
and
He shall reign
to
the
ages
of the
ages.
And
the
twenty
four
elders
-
before
-
God
sitting
on
the
throne
of Him,
fell
on
the
faces
of them,
and
worshiped
-
God,
saying,
We thank
You,
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty,
the (One)
being
and
who
was,
because
you took
the
power
of You
-
great,
and
reigned;
And
the
nations
were wrathful,
and
came
the
wrath
of You,
and
the
time
of the
dead
to be judged,
and
to give
the
reward
to the
slaves
of You
to the

and
to the
saints
and
to those
fearing
the
name
of You,
to the
small
and
to the
great,
and
to destroy
the (ones)

And
was opened
the
temple
-
of God
-
in
-
Heaven,
and
was seen
the
ark
of the
covenant
of Him
in
the
temple
of Him;
and
occurred
lightnings
and
sounds
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
and
a hail
great.
And
a sign
great
was seen
in
the
heavens,
a woman
having been clothed (with)
the
sun,
and
the
moon
underneath
the
feet
of her,
and
on
the
head
of her
a crown
of stars
twelve;
and
in
womb

and
she cries
being in travail,
and
being distressed
to bear.
And
was seen
another
sign
in
the
heaven,
and
behold!

having

and
horns

and
on

diadems
And
the
tail
of him
draws
the
third (part)
of the
stars
of the
heaven,
and
throws
them
onto
the
earth;
and
the
dragon
stood
before
the
woman
-
being about
to bear,
that,
when
she bears
the
child
of her
he may devour.
And
she bore
a son,
a male,
who
is going to
shepherd
all
the
nations
with
staff
an iron
and
was seized
the
child
of her
to
-
God
and
to
the
throne
of Him.
And
the
woman
fled
into
the
wilderness,
where
she has
there
a place
having been readied
from
-
God,
that
there
they might nourish
her
days
a thousand
two hundred
(and) sixty.
And
occurred
war
in
-
Heaven,
-
Michael
and
the
angels
of Him
-
made war
with
the
dragon;
and
the
dragon
warred,
and
the
angels
of him,
and
not
they prevailed,
nor
place
was found
of them
yet
in
-
Heaven.
And
was cast
the
dragon
-
great,
the
serpent
-
old,
-
being called
devil
and
-
Satan,
the (one)
deceiving
the
habitable world
whole;
was cast
to
the
earth,
and
the
angels
of him
with
him
were cast.
And
I heard
voice
a great
in
-
Heaven,
saying
Now
has come
the
salvation
and
the
power
and
the
kingdom
of the
God
of us
and
the
authority
of the
Christ
of Him;
because
is cast down
the
accuser
of the
brothers
of us,
the (one)
accusing
them
before
the
God
of us
day
and
night.
And
they
overcame
him
because
of the
blood
of the
Lamb,
and
because
of the
Word
of the
witness
of them,
and
not
they loved
the
life
of them
until
death.
Because
of this
be glad,
the
heavens
and
those
in
them
tabernacling;
woe to
the
earth
and
the
sea,
because
came down
the
devil
to
you
having
anger
great,
knowing
that
a little
time
he has.
And
when
saw
the
dragon
that
he was cast
into
the
earth,
he chased
the
woman
who
bore
the
male.
And
were given
to the
woman
-
two
wings
of the
eagle
-
great,
that
she may fly
into
the
wilderness
to
the
place
of her,
where
she is nourished
there
a time,
and
times
and
half
a time,
from
(the) face
of the
serpent.
And
threw
the
serpent
out of
the
mouth
of him
after
the
woman
water
as
a river,
that
her
carried off by the river
he might make.
And
helped
the
earth
the
woman,
and
opened
the
earth
the
mouth
of it,
and
swallowed
the
river
which
cast
the
dragon
out of
the
mouth
of him.
And
was enraged
the
dragon
over
the
woman,
and
went away
to make
war
with
the
rest
of the
seed
of her,
the (ones)
keeping
the
commandments
-
of God
and
having
the
witness
of Jesus.
And
I stood
on
the
sand
of the
sea.
And
I saw
out of
the
sea
a beast
coming up,
having
horns
ten,
and
seven
heads
and
on
the
horns
of it
ten
diadems,
and
on
the
heads
of it
names
of blasphemy.
And
the
beast,
which
I saw,
was
like
a leopard,
and
the
feet
of it
as
of a bear,
and
the
mouth
of it
as
(the) mouth
of a lion;
and
gave
to it
the
dragon
the
power
of it
and
the
throne
of it,
and
authority
great.
And
one
of
the
heads
of it
as
having been slain
to
death;
and
the
wound
of the
death
of it
was healed;
and
marveled
all
the
earth
after
the
beast;
and
they worshiped
the
dragon
because
he gave
the
authority
to the
beast,
and
they worshiped
the
beast,
saying,
Who
(is) like
the
beast,
and
who
is able
to make war
with
it?
And
was given
to it
a mouth
speaking
great things
and
blaphemies;
and
was given
to it
authority
to perform
months
forty
and
two.
And
it opened
the
mouth
of it
in
blasphemy
toward
-
God,
to blaspheme
the
name
of Him,
and
the
tabernacle
of Him,
and
in
-
Heaven
tabernacling.
And
was given
to it
to make
war
with
the
saints
and
to overcome
them;
and
was given
to it
authority
over
every
tribe
and
people
and
tongue
and
nation.
And
will worship
it
all
the (ones)
dwelling
on
the
earth,
of whom
not
was written
the
names
-
in
the
Scroll
-
of Life
of the
Lamb
-
having been slain
from
(the) foundation
world's.
If
anyone
has
an ear
let him hear.
If
anyone
(is to go) into
captivity
into
captivity
he goes.
If
anyone
by
a sword
will kill,
he
by
a sword
be killed.
Here
is
the
patience
and
the
faith
of the
saints.
And
I saw
another
beast
coming up
out of
the
earth,
and
it had
horns
two
like
a lamb,
and
it spoke
as
a dragon.
And
the
authority
of the
first
beast
all
it does
before
it.
And
it makes
the
earth
and
the (ones)
in
it
dwelling
that
they should worship
the
beast
-
first,
of which
was healed
the
wound
-
of death
of it.
And
it does
signs
great,
that
even
fire
it makes
out of
the
heaven
to come down
onto
the
earth
before
-
men.
And
it deceives
those
dwelling
on
the
earth
because of
the
signs
which
were given
to it
to do
before
the
beast,
saying
to those
dwelling
on
the
earth
to make
an image
to the
beast
who
has
the
wound
of the
sword
and
lived.
And
was given
to it
to give
a spirit
to the
image
of the
beast,
that
even
might speak
the
image
of the
beast,
and
might make,
that
as many as
-
would not
worship
the
image
of the
beast
(they) be killed.
And
it makes
all,
the
small
and
the
great,
and
the
rich
and
the
poor,
and
the
freemen
and
the
slave,
that
it may give
to them
a mark
on
the
hand
of them
-
right
or
on
the
foreheads
of them,
and
that
not
anyone
could
buy
or
sell,
if
not

the
mark,
the
name
of the
beast,
or
the
number
of the
name
of it.
Here
-
wisdom
is.
The (one)

the
number
of the
beast
(the) number
for
of a man

and
the
number
of it

And
I saw,
and
behold!
(The)

standing
on

of the
Father
of Him
having been written
on

And
I heard
a sound
out
of
Heaven,
as
a sound
of waters
many,
and
as
a sound
of thunder
great;
and
-
a sound
which
I heard
(was) as
of harpers
harping
on
the
harps
of them.
And
they sang
as
a song
new
before
the
throne,
and
before
the
four
living creatures
and
the
elders;
and
no one
was able
to learn
the
song,

except
the

from

I saw
another
angel
flying
in
mid-heaven,
having
a gospel
everlasting,
to proclaim

to those
dwelling
on
the
earth,
and
to
every
nation

And
another
angel,
a third
followed
them,
saying
in
voice
a great,
If

worships
the

and
the
image
of it,
and

undiluted
in

will be tormented
in

And
another

of
the
number
of the
name
of it,
standing
on
the
sea
-
glassy,
having
harps
-
of God.
And
they sing
the
song
of Moses
the
slave
-
of God,
and
the
song
of the
Lamb,
saying,
Great
and
marvelous
the
works
of You,
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty;
righteous
and
\\"\\"true\\"\\
the
ways
of You,
the
King
of the
saints.
Who
in
no way
fear
Lord,
and
glorify
the
name
of You?
For
(You) only
(are) holy;
because
all
the
nations
will come
and
will worship
before
You,
because
the
righteousnesses
of You
were revealed.
And
after
these things
I saw,
and
was opened
The
temple
of the
tent
of the
testimony
in
-
Heaven;
and
came forth
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
plagues
out of
the
temple,
being clothed (in)
linen
clean
bright,
and
having been girded
around
the
breasts
(with) girdles
of gold.
And
one
of
the
four
living creatures
gave
to the
seven
angels
seven
bowls
of gold
filled
of the
anger
-
of God
the
living
to
the
ages
of the
ages.
And
was filled
the
temple
of smoke
of
the
glory
-
of God,
and
of
the
power
of Him;
and
no one
was able
to enter
into
the
temple,
until
should be finished
the
seven
plagues
of the
seven
angels.
And
I heard
voice
a great
out of
the
temple,
saying
to the
seven
angels,
Go,
and
pour out
the
seven
bowls
of the
anger
-
of God
onto
the
earth.
And
went away
the
first
and
poured out
the
bowl
of him
on
the
earth;
and
it became
sore
a bad
and
evil
on
the
men
the (ones)
having
the
mark
of the
beast,
and
the (ones)
worshiping.
the
image
of him
And
the
second
poured out
the
bowl
of him
onto
the
sea;
and
it became
blood
as
of a dead one,
and
every
soul
living
died
-
in
the
sea.
And
the
third
poured out
the
bowl
of him
onto
the
rivers
and
the
fountains
of the
waters;
and
it became
blood.
And
I heard
the
angel
of the
waters
saying,
Righteous,
You are
the (One)
being,
and
who
was,
the
Holy One,
because
these things
You judged;
since
(the) blood
of saints
and
prophets
they poured out,
and
blood
of them
You gave
to drink;
deserving
they are.
And
I heard
the
altar
saying,
Yes,
Lord
-
God
-
Almighty,
\\"\\"true\\"\\
and
righteous
the
judgments
of You.
And
the
fourth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
on
the
sun,
and
it was given
to it
to burn
-
men
with
fire.
And
were burned
-
men
(with) heat
great,
and
they blasphemed
the
name
-
God
the (One)
having
-
authority
over
-
plagues
these,
and
not
they repented
to give
Him
glory.
And
the
fifth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
onto
the
throne
of the
beast;
and
became
the
kingdom
of it
darkened;
and
they gnawed
the
tongue
of them
from
the
pain;
and
they blasphemed
the
God
-
of Heaven
from
the
pains
of them
and
from
the
sores
of them,
and
not
they repented
from
the
works
of them.
And
the
sixth
poured out
the
bowl
of him
onto
the
river
-
great
-
Euphrates,
and
was dried up
the
water
of it,
that
might be prepared
the
way
of the
kings
-
from
(the) rising
of (the) Sun.
And
I saw
out of
the
mouth
of the
dragon,
and
out of
the
mouth
of the
beast,
and
out of
the
mouth
of the
false prophet,
spirits
three
unclean
like
frogs;
they are
For

doing
signs,
which

to
the
kings
of the
habitable world
whole,
to assemble
them
to
the
war
-
of day
the
great
(Day)
of God
the
Almighty.
Behold!
I am coming
as
a thief;
blessed
(is) the (one)
watching
and
keeping
the
garments
of him,
that
not
naked
he may walk,
and
they may see
the
shame
of him.
And
he assembled
them
in
the
place
-
having been called
in Hebrew
Armageddon.
And
the
seventh
poured out
the
bowl
of him
into
the
air;
and
came
a voice
great
out of
the
temple
from
the
throne
saying,
It has happened.
And
occurred
lightnings,
and
voices
and
thunders
and
an earthquake
occurred
great,
such as
not
did occur
from
when
man
came into being
on
the
earth,
such a huge
earthquake,
so
great.
And
came to be
the
city
-
great
into
three
parts,
and
the
cities
of the
nations
fell;
and
Babylon
the
great
was remembered
before
-
God,
to give
to her
the
cup
of the
wine
of the
anger
of the
wrath
of Him.
And
every
island
fled,
and
mountains
not
were found.
And
a hail
great,
as
talentsized,
comes down
out of
the
heaven
on
-
man;
and
baslphemed
-
men
-
God
from
the
plague
of the
hail,
because
great
is
the
plague
of it
exceedingly.
And
came
one
of
the
seven
angels
-
having
the
seven
bowls,
and
spoke
with
me,
saying,
come,
I will show
you
the
judgment
of the
harlot
-
great,
-
sitting
on
waters
many;
with
whom
do fornication
the
kings
of the
earth,
and
became drunk
those
inhabiting
the
earth.
from
the
wine
of the
fornication
of her
And
he carried away
me
into
a desert
by
(the) Spirit;
and
I saw
a woman
sitting
on
beast
a scarlet,
full of
names
of blasphemy,
having
heads
seven
and
horns
ten.
And
the
woman
was
having been clothed (in)
purple
and
scarlet,
and
having been gilded
with gold
and
stone
precious
and
pearls,
having
cup
a golden
in
the
hand
of her,
full
of abominations
and
-
uncleanness
of (the)
fornication
of her,
and
on
the
forehead
of her
a name
having been written,
MYSTERY,
Babylon
THE
GREAT,
the
Mother
of the
Harlots
and
of the
abominations
of the
earth.
And
I saw
the
woman
being drunk
from
the
blood
of the
saints,
and
from
the
blood
of the
witnesses
of Jesus.
And
I marveled,
seeing
her,
marvel
a great.
And
said
to me
the
angel,
Why
-
did you marvel?
I
will tell
you
the
mystery
of the
woman,
and
of the
beast
-
sustaining
her,
the (one)
having
the
seven
heads
and
the
ten
horns.
The
beast,
which
you saw,
was,
and
not
is,
and
is about
to come up
from
the
abyss,
and
to
perdition
goes.
And
will marvel
those
dwelling
on
the
earth,
of whom
not has been
written
the
names
on
the
Scroll
-
of Life
from
(the) foundation
of (the) world,
seeing
the
beast
that
it was
and
not
is,
and
will be present.
Here
(is) the
mind
-
having
wisdom.
The
seven
heads
seven,
mountains
are
where
the
woman
sits
on
them.
And
kings
seven
are;
the
five
fell,
the
one
is,
the
other
not yet
come;
and,
when
he comes,
a little
he
must
remain.
And
the
beast
which
was,
and
not
is,
even
he
eighth
is,
and
of
the
seven
is,
and
to
perdition
goes.
And
the
ten
horns,
which
you saw,
ten
kings
are,
who
a kingdom
not yet
received,
but
authority
as
kings
one
hour
receive
with
the
beast.
These
one
mind
have,
and
the
power
and
the authority
of themselves
to the
beast
they give.
These
with
the
Lamb
will make war,
and
the
Lamb
will overcome
them,
because
Lord
of lords
is
and
King
of kings,
and
those
with
him,
(the) called
and
elect
and
faithful.
And
he says
to me,
The
waters,
which
you saw,
where
the
harlot
sits,
peoples
and
crowds
are,
and
nations
and
tongues.
And
the
ten
horns,
which
you saw,
and
the
beast,
these
will hate
the
harlot,
and
laid waste
will make
her
and
naked,
and
the
flesh
of her
they will eat,
and
her
will burn down
with
fire.
-
For
God
gave
into
the
hearts
of them
to do
the
mind
of Him,
and
to do
one
mind,
and
to give
the
kingdom
of them
to the
beast,
untill
shall be completed
the
words
-
of God.
And
the
woman
whom
you saw,
is
the
city
-
great,
-
having
a kingdom
over
the
kings
of the
earth.
After
these things
I saw
another
angel
coming down
out of
-
Heaven,
having
authority
great;
and
the
earth
was lighted
from
the
glory
of him.
And
he cried
in
a strong
voice
saying,
Has fallen,
has fallen
Babylon
the
great,
and
has become
a dwelling place
of demons,
and
a prison
of every
spirit
unclean,
and
a prison
of every
bird
unclean,
and
a prison
of every
beast
unclean
and
having been hated.
Because
of
the
wine
of the
anger
of the
fornication
of her
have drunk
all
the
nations,
and
the
kings,
of the
earth
with
her
committed fornication,
and
the
merchants
of the
earth
from
the
power
of the
luxury
of her
became rich.
And
I heard
another
voice
out of
-
Heaven,
saying,
Come out
-
people
of Me,
of
her
that
not
you share
the
sins
of her,
and
of
the
plagues
of her
that
not
you receive
because
joined together
of her
the
sins
up to
-
Heaven,
and
rememebered
-
God
the
unjust deeds
of her.
Return
to her
as
also
she
returned
and
double
the
double
according to
the
works
of her;
in
the
cup
in which she
mixed,
mix
to her
double.
By what things
she glorified
herself
and
luxuriated,
such
give
to her
torment
and
mourning;
because
in
the
heart
of her
she says,
-
I sit
a queen,
and
a widow
not
I am,
and
mourning
not
at all
I see.
Because
of this
in
one
day
shall come
the
plagues
of her,
death
and
mourning
and
famine,
and
with
fire
she will be burned up,
because
strong
(is the) Lord
-
God
-
judging
her.
And
will weep for
and
will wail
over
her
the
kings
of the
earth,
those
with
her
having fornicated
and
having luxuriated,
when
they see
the
smoke
of the
burning
of her,
from
afar
standing
because
of the
fear
of the
torment
of her,
saying,
Woe!
Woe,
to the
city
-
great
Babylon,
the
city
-
strong,
because
one
hour
came
the
judgment
of you!
And
the
merchants
of the
earth
weep
and
mourn
over
her,
because
the
cargo
of them
no one
buys
no more;
cargo
of gold,
and
of silver,
and
of stone
precious,
and
of pearls,
and
of fine linen,
and
of purple,
and
of silk,
and
of scarlet;

and

and

of men.
And
the

of the

went away
from
you,
and
all
the
fat things
and
the
bright things
went away
from

and

you will find
The
merchants
of these,
those
being enriched
from
her,
from
afar
will stand
because
of the
fear
of the
torment
of her,
weeping
and
mourning,
saying,
Woe!
Woe,
the
city
-
great,
-
having been clothed in
linen
and
purple
and
scarlet,
and
having been glided
in
gold
and
stone
precious
and
pearls;
because
in one
hour
was desolated
such
great
wealth!
And
every

and
all
-
to

sailing,
and
sailors,
and
as many as
the
sea
work,
from
afar
stood,
and
cried out,
seeing
the
smoke
of the
burning
of her,
saying,
What
(is) like
the
city
-
great?
and
they threw
dust
on
the
heads
of them,
and
cried out
weeping
and
mourning,
saying,
Woe!
Woe,
(to) the
city
-
great,
by
which
were enriched
all
the (ones)

was she ruined!
Be glad
over
her,
Heaven,
and
the
holy
and

apostles
and
the
prophets,
because
judged
-
God
the
judgment
of you
on
her.
And
lifted
one
angel
strong
a stone
as
a millstone
great,
and
threw (it)
into
the
sea,
saying,
Thus
on an impulse
will be thrown

city,

yet.
And
sound
of harpers
and
of musicians

of trumpeters
not
at all
will be heard
in
you
still,
and
every
craftsman
of every

not

and
a sound
of a mill
not

will be heard
in
you
still,
and
light
of a lamp
not
at all
(shall) shine
in
you
still,
and
voice
of groom
and
bride
not
at all
will be heard
in
you
still;
for
the
merchants
of you
were
the
great ones
of the
earth,
for
by
the
sorceries
of you
were led astray
all
the
nations,
And
in
her
(the) blood
of prophets
and
saints
were found,
and
of all

on
the

After
these things
I heard
as (it were)
a voice
a loud
of a multitude
many
in

Heaven,
saying,
Hallelujah!

and
He avenged
the
blood

And
secondly
they said,
Hallelujah!
And
the
smoke
of her
goes up
to

And
fell down

four,

a voice

came out,
saying,

of Him,
and
those
fearing
Him,

And
I heard
as

as

saying,

And
He has

And
I saw
one
angel
standing
in
the
sun
and
he cried
in
voice
with a great,
saying
to all
the
birds
-
flying
in
mid-heaven,
Come
gather together
to
the
supper
of the

God,
that
you may eat

and
(the) flesh
of all,

And
I saw
the
beast,
and
the
kings
of the
earth,
and
the
armies
of them
being assembled
to make

war
with
the (One)
sitting

and
with

of Him.
And
was seized
the
beast,
and
with
this (one)
the
false prophet
-
doing
the
signs
before
it,
by
which
he led astray
those
having received

on
the
horse,
-
having gone forth
from
the
mouth
of Him;
and
all
the
birds
were filled
from
the

of them.
And
I saw
an angel
coming down
out of

Heaven
having
the
key
of the

and
a chain

on

of him.
And
he laid hold

bound
him

threw

time.
And
I saw
thrones,
and
they sat
on
them,
and
judgment
was given
to them;
and
the
souls
of those
having been beheaded
due
to the
witness
of Jesus,
and
because
of the
Word
-
of God,
and
who
not
had worshiped
the
beast,
nor
the
image
of him,
and
not
received
the
mark
on
the
forehead
and
on
the
hand
of them;
and
they lived,
and
reigned
with
-
Christ
a thousand
years.
the
rest
of the
dead
not
lived again
until
were ended
the
thousand
years.
This
(is) the
resurrection
-
first.
Blessed
and
holy
he
having
part
in
the
resurrection
-
first;
over
these
the
second
death
not
has
authority,
but
they will be
priests
-
of God
and
-
of Christ,
and
will reign
with
Him
Him
a thousand
years.
And
when
are finished
the
thousand
years,
will be loosed
-
Satan
from
the
prison
of him,
and
he will go out
to lead astray
the
nations
-
in
the
four
corners
of the
earth,
-
Gog
and
Magog,
to assemble
them
in
-
war;
of whom
the
numbers
-
(is) as
the
sand
of the
sea.
And
they went up
over
the
breadth
of the
land
and
encircled
the
camp
of the
saints
and
the
city
-
beloved;
and
came down
fire
from
-
Heaven
and
burned down
them.
And
the
devil
-
leading astray
them
was thrown
into
the
Lake
-
oif Fire
and
Brimstone,
where
-
the
beast
and
the
false prophet (are);
and
they will be tormented
day
and
night
to
the
ages
of the
ages.
And
I saw
a throne
great,
white
and
the (One)
sitting
on
it
of whom
from
the
face
fled
the
earth
and
the
heaven,
and
a place
not
was found
for them.
And
I saw
the
dead,
the
great,
and
the
small
standing
before
-
God,
and
scrolls
were opened;
and
another
scroll
was opened,
which
is
the
(Scroll) of Life;
and
were judged
the
dead
out of
those
having been written
in
the
scrolls,
according to
the
works
of them.
And
gave
the
sea
the
dead
-
in
it,
and
-
death
and
-
Hades
gave
the
dead
-
in
them,
and
they were judged
each
according to
the
works
of them.
And
-
death
and
-
Hades
were thrown
into
the
Lake
-
of Fire;
This
the
death
-
second
is.
The
Lake
-
of Fire.
And
if
anyone
not
was found
in
the
Scroll
-
of Life
having been written,
he was thrown
into
the
Lake
-
of Fire.
And
I saw
heaven
a new
and
earth
new;
the
for
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
passed away,
and
the
sea
not
is
yet.
And
the
city
-
holy
Jerusalem
New,
saw
coming down
out of
-
Heaven,
from
-
God
having prepared
as
a bride
having been adorned
for the
Husband
of her.
And
I heard
a voice
great
out of
-
throne,
saying,
Behold!
The
tabernacle
-
of God
with
-
men,
and
He will tabernacle
with
them,
and
they
peoples
of Him
will be,
and
Himself
-
God
with
them,
will be
of them
God.
And
will wipe away
every
tear
from
the
eyes
of them,
and
-
death;
not
will be
longer;
nor
mourning,
nor
outcry,
nor
pain
now
will be
longer;
for
the
first things
passed away.
And
said
the (One)
sitting
on
the
throne,
Behold!
new
I make.
all things
And
He says,
Write;
because
these
-
words
faithful
and
\\"\\"true\\"\\
are.
And
He said
to me,
It is done.
I
am
the
Alpha
and
the
Omega,
the
Head
and
the
End.
I
to (the one)
thirsting
will give
of
the
fountain
of the
water
-
of life
freely.
The (one)
overcoming
will inherit
all things,
and
I will be
to him
God,
and
he
will be
to me
the son.

But

is

And
came

with
me,
saying,

Lamb
And
he carried
me
in
Spirit
onto
mount
a great
and
high,
and
showed
to me
the
city
-
Holy
Jerusalem,
coming down
out of
-
Heaven
from
-
God,
having
the
glory
-
of God;
the
light
of it
(was) like
a stone
very precious,
as
stone
a jasper
being clear as crystal;
having
wall
a great
and
high,
having
gates
twelve,
and
on
the
gates
angels
twelve,
and
names
having been inscribed,
which
are
the
names
the
twelve
tribes
sons
of Israel.
From

And
the

of the
city
having

twelve,
and
in
them
twelve
names
of the
twelve
apostles
of the
Lamb.
And
he
speaking
with
me
had
measuring
rod
of gold,
that
he may measure
the
city,
and
the
gates
of it,
and
the
wall
of it.
And
the
city
four-cornered
lies,
and
the
length
of it
as much as
also
the

And
he measured
the
city
with the
reed
at
stadia

thousands;
the
length
and
the
width
and
the
height
of it
equal
are.
And
he measured
the
wall
of it
a hundred
(and) forty
four
cubits,
a measure
of a man,
which
is
of an angel.
And

and
the

And
the
twelve
gates,
(were) twelve
pearls;
respectively
one
each
of the
gates
was
of
one
pearl;
and
the
street
of the
city
(was) of gold
pure,
as
glass
transparent.
And
a temple
not
I saw
in
it;
the
for

-
God
-

temple
of it

even
the

And
the
city
not
need
had
of the
Sun,
nor
of the
moon,
that
they may shine
it;
the
for
(the) glory
-
of God

it,
even
the

And
will walk;
the
nations
by
the
light
of it,
and
the
kings
of the
earth
bring
the
glory
of them
into
it.
and
the
gates
of it
not
at all
may be shut
by day
night
for
not
is
there;
and
they will bring
the
glory
and
the
honor
of the
nations
into
it.
And
not
at all

into
it

and

(any) making
an abomination
and
a lie;
except
those
-
having been written
in
the
Scroll
-
of Life

Lamb.
And
he showd
me
river
of water
of life,
bright
as
crystal,
coming forth
out of
the
throne
-
of God
and
the
Lamb.
In
(the) midst
of the
street
of it,
and of
the
river
from here
and
from there,
a tree
of life,
producing
fruits
twelve,
according to
month
each
yielding
the
fruit
of it,
and
the
leaves
of the
tree
(will be) for
healing
of the
nations.
And
every
curse
not
will
be still;
and
the
throne
-
of God
and
the
Lamb
in
it
will be;
and
the
slaves
of Him
will seve
to Him,
and
they will see
the
face
of Him;
and
the
name
of Him
(will be) on
the
forheads
of them.
And

not
will be,
no longer

to me,
